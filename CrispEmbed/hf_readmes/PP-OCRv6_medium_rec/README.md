# PP-OCRv6 medium recognizer — CrispEmbed GGUF

Files: `PP-OCRv6_medium_rec-f16.gguf`, `PP-OCRv6_medium_rec-f32.gguf`,
`PP-OCRv6_medium_rec-q8-head.gguf`, and
`PP-OCRv6_medium_rec-crispasr-q4_k-policy.gguf`.

The policy-q4 container intentionally keeps the complete PP-OCRv6 recognizer graph in F16: quantizing intermediate CNN/SVTR weights caused compounding CTC drift. Source: PaddlePaddle PP-OCRv6, Apache-2.0.

The native F32 conversion matches the reference through logits (cosine 1.0). The published F16 artifact is an inference-speed artifact, not a parity claim: repeated half-precision layers accumulate measurable drift, so production quality should use the Q8/F32-quality policy artifact once published.

`q8-head` is built from F32 and quantizes only the final SVTR/CTC head;
measured logits cosine is 0.999934.
