"""Generate examples/cli/model_hashes.h — SHA-256 pins for every auto-download
model in CrispEmbed's registry.

The registry in examples/cli/model_mgr.cpp hands curl/wget an https URL and
renames whatever comes back into the model cache. Without a pin, a compromised
or swapped re-host silently replaces the weights of an already-trusted model
name. GGUF is a graph plus tensor data that the process then executes; "it
downloaded fine" is not an integrity statement.

Hashes come from HuggingFace's tree API, which reports the SHA-256 of every
LFS-backed file without transferring it:

    GET /api/models/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<rev>?recursive=1
        -> [{"path": ..., "lfs": {"oid": "<sha256>"}}, ...]

Only `lfs.oid` is a SHA-256. A non-LFS file's `oid` is a git blob SHA-1 and is
NOT interchangeable — such files are reported as unpinnable rather than pinned
with the wrong digest.

Usage:
    python tools/fetch_model_hashes.py              # rewrite the header
    python tools/fetch_model_hashes.py --check      # CI: fail if stale
    python tools/fetch_model_hashes.py --json       # dump what was resolved
    python tools/fetch_model_hashes.py --check-sizes  # CI: declared vs real size

The same tree call also carries each file's size, so the declared `approx_size`
in the registry can be checked against reality for free. That matters because
the size is what a user is shown before agreeing to a download, and nothing
else verifies it: this check found four wrong entries on its first run, on top
of the four the pinning audit had already found by hand.
