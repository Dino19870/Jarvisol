"""Regression test for the biometric acknowledgement gate.

POLICY.md §4 tells integrators that loading a face *recognition* model
requires an explicit acknowledgement, and that detection is never gated.
That sentence is the one a reader relies on, and before this test nothing
checked it: the gate lived only in the CLI for a while, and every binding
was open. A refactor of ``crispembed_face_init()`` could remove it again
without breaking anything else.

What is asserted here is the contract as documented, not an implementation
detail:

  * a detection model loads with no acknowledgement (a box is not a template)
  * a recognition model is refused without one
  * ``CRISPEMBED_ACCEPT_BIOMETRIC=1`` satisfies the gate
  * ``crispembed.accept_biometric_use()`` satisfies the gate
  * a *renamed* recognition model is still refused — the gate keys on the
    model's declared type, not on its filename
  * the CLI refuses non-interactively and proceeds with ``--accept-biometric``
  * ``--dim`` is refused too, on both CLI paths that reach it — reading a
    property off a recognition model is still loading one

The acknowledgement is a process-wide latch that cannot be cleared, so each
case runs in its own subprocess.

This is a speed bump and an audit trail, not a security control — the check
is trivially removable from MIT-licensed code. The test exists so that its
removal is deliberate rather than accidental.

Models (a detection and a recognition GGUF) are found via, in order:
``--det-model`` / ``--rec-model``, ``CRISPEMBED_DET_MODEL`` /
``CRISPEMBED_REC_MODEL``, or a ``yunet.gguf`` / ``sface.gguf`` in
``CRISPEMBED_GGUF_DIR``. Without them the test reports an explicit skip
rather than silently claiming to have run.

Usage:
    python tests/test_biometric_gate.py
    python tests/test_biometric_gate.py --det-model yunet.gguf --rec-model sface.gguf
