"""Assert that crispembed-server's --image-root actually confines request paths.

POLICY.md §4 tells deployers to set --image-root whenever the port is not
loopback-only, on the grounds that endpoints read images by server-side path
and /face turns any readable file into a biometric template. That promise is
only worth making if the confinement resists the obvious escapes, so this
exercises them against a live server:

  in-root          -> served
  absolute outside -> refused
  ../ traversal    -> refused
  symlink out      -> refused
  sibling prefix   -> refused   (/srv/scansEVIL vs /srv/scans — the bug a
                                 naive startswith() check would ship)

Refusal is deliberately indistinguishable from "no image path" in the HTTP
response, so an unauthenticated caller cannot probe for file existence; the
reason goes to the server's stderr instead, and this asserts on both.

It also probes endpoints registered LATE in server.cpp. A local
`extract_image_path` lambda once shadowed the confining file-scope function for
every handler below it, so --image-root covered the first 13 endpoints and
silently missed the next 20 — including every super-resolution and restoration
engine. This test did not catch that, because /detect sits above the shadow.
Probing both sides is the regression guard.

Usage:
    python tests/test_image_root.py --det-model yunet.gguf [--build-dir build]
