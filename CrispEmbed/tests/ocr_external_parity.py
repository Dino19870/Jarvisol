"""Head-to-head OCR parity: CrispEmbed vs Tesseract / EasyOCR / PaddleOCR /
a full document parser.

Existing harnesses in this repo compare CrispEmbed against per-stage tensor
references.  That proves a graph is faithful; it says nothing about whether the
shipped pipeline reads a page as well or as fast as the engine it ports.  This
runs the external engines and the native ones over the same images and reports
the two numbers a user actually feels: transcription error and latency.

Two quality scores are produced because they answer different questions:

  * ``cer``/``wer`` vs ground truth  — absolute quality.  Only available for the
    synthetic corpus (``tests/ocr_synth_corpus.py``), which knows its own text.
  * ``cer`` vs a reference *engine*  — port fidelity.  A CrispEmbed engine that
    disagrees with the upstream engine it ports is a runtime bug to bisect with
    ``crispembed-diff``, independent of how hard the page is.

Timing is deliberately reported in two columns, because the arms are not
symmetric (dev-guide rule 4a): ``proc_ms`` is wall time for a whole invocation
including model load — what a CLI user pays — while ``engine_ms`` excludes model
load (parsed from native stage-bench stderr, or measured directly for the
in-process Python engines).  Never mix the two columns in a speed claim.

One arm is not a flat OCR engine at all but a whole document parser (layout +
OCR + table structure).  It is scored the same way on purpose: what a caller
gets back from a document parser is the exported document, so its layout stage
is part of its transcription quality, not a separate concern.  See ``DoclingPy``
for the two views it records and why.

    """Full document-parser arm: layout analysis + OCR + structure, in-process.

    This is a different *shape* of reference from the flat OCR arms above.  A
    document parser does not emit "every recognised line"; it emits a document
    tree, and only the text its layout stage files under a text-bearing element
    survives into the export.  Anything the layout model calls a picture is
    exported as an image placeholder and its recognised words are dropped.  So
    two numbers are recorded per fixture:

      * ``text``          — the plain text of the exported document.  This is
                            what a caller of the library actually receives, and
                            it is what CER/WER score.
      * ``alt_texts["all_text_items"]`` — every recognised text item in the
                            document, including ones nested under a picture.
                            Scoring both separates "the OCR missed it" from
                            "the layout stage discarded it"; collapsing them
                            into one number would blame the recogniser for a
                            layout decision.

    Markdown is kept alongside (``extra["markdown"]``) so a later structure gate
    can score tables/headings without re-running the parse.

    The parser is built once and warmed with a throwaway parse, so the reported
    ``proc_ms`` and ``engine_ms`` are the same load-excluded number.  The warm-up
    matters more than usual here: the layout detector runs under a tracing JIT,
    so the very first parse pays a multi-second compile that is not part of
    steady-state cost.

        mysterious quality shift.
      * Greedy decoding, no sampling.  Anything else makes the gold irreproducible.
      * Preprocessor defaults are left alone: ``min_pixels``/``max_pixels`` decide
        how many vision tokens a page gets, i.e. the effective resolution the model
        reads at, and overriding them would make the numbers unquotable against the
        published model.

    Weights are loaded once and warmed with a throwaway generation, so ``proc_ms``
    and ``engine_ms`` are the same load-excluded number.  A page here costs seconds
    to minutes, so ``--repeats 1`` is the expected setting; timing is only ever
    comparable within one host.

    ``transcripts`` writes one ``<fixture>.txt`` per page plus a ``manifest.json``
    pinning model id, resolved revision, prompt, decoding params and hardware —
    that directory is the artifact the native lane's CER gate reads.
