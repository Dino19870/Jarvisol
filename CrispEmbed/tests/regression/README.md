# CrispEmbed OCR portfolio regression suite

## Real-world public-domain robustness fixtures

The checked-in corpus now has a small seed set under `images/cc0/` for cases
that synthetic fixtures do not cover: receipts, a historical receipt scan,
Arabic printed/handwritten text, a handwritten letter, and a form.  Sources,
license declarations, URLs, and SHA-256 checksums are recorded in
`images/cc0/MANIFEST.json`; the source catalog is
`cc0_sources.json`.  Fetch or refresh them with:

```sh
python3 tests/regression/fetch_cc0_fixtures.py
```

Stage coverage and the distinction between real-world and deterministic
reference inputs are recorded in `corpus_manifest.json`.

Deterministic robustness derivatives are under `images/derived/`. Their
`MANIFEST.json` records the parent fixture hash and transformation recipe for
each skew, border, illumination, haze, speckle, low-DPI, JPEG, rotation,
perspective, and mixed-orientation variant. Recreate them with:

```sh
python3 tests/regression/generate_derived_fixtures.py
python3 tests/regression/test_derived_fixtures.py
```

Include those variants in the live raw/cleanup/binarization sweep with
`--include-derived`; the flag is opt-in because the 45-image run is much more
expensive than the seed-corpus smoke pass.

The complete engine inventory—including engines whose runtime exists but whose
GGUF still needs downloading or porting—is in `ocr_engine_matrix.json`.
`ocr_engine_benchmark.py --download-missing` resolves manifest-pinned GGUFs
from their Hugging Face repositories instead of treating an empty local cache
as lack of support.

For large GGUFs on an external volume, add `--mmap` to use the no-copy loader
when the engine supports it:

```sh
python tests/ocr_engine_benchmark.py --only unlimited-ocr-stacked \
  --gpu-backend metal --mmap --repeats 1 --timeout 300
```

The seed set now also includes German public-domain/CC0 inputs: an 1848 Berlin
citizenship document, a German official-print page, and German Kurrent
handwriting.  These are sourced from Wikimedia Commons and are tracked with
the same checksum/license metadata.  A larger German historical OCR source is
the CC0/public-domain [German PD Newspapers dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/storytracer/German-PD-Newspapers),
which should be sampled rather than vendored wholesale.

The seed set is intentionally not treated as gold transcription data until a
human verifies each transcription.  It is suitable immediately for live
robustness, preprocessing, orientation, layout, and language-routing checks.
Rotated and skewed derivatives may be generated from these public-domain
images without adding third-party licensing obligations.  The next expansion
should use the CC0 ExpressExpense receipt set (200 real restaurant receipts)
and the CC0 Arabic Documents OCR set (10K images with page/text annotations),
but those sources require a separate download/acceptance step and are therefore
not vendored by default.

A model-output regression suite for the OCR engines. It exists because a
vision-neck permute regression (`3fb1f8e`, Jun 2026) shipped **garbage OCR**
(`colorcolorcolor…`) that the existing Kaggle `ocr-gpu-bench` kernel could not
catch — that kernel only checked process exit codes (garbage still exits 0) and
did not even include got-ocr2. See `docs/got-ocr2.md` and `LEARNINGS.md`.

## What each model run checks

For every model in `manifest.json`, `run_one.py`:

1. **Downloads** the GGUF under test (pinned to an HF revision SHA, so an
   upstream re-quantise can't silently change what we test).
2. **Runs** `crispembed -m <gguf> --ocr <image>` and captures stdout.
3. **No-garbage guard** — rejects the `colorcolor…` degeneration signature
   (a single word or short substring repeated far beyond real text). This is
   the check that would have caught `3fb1f8e`.
4. **Lenient text match** — normalises case/punctuation/whitespace and requires
   the character error rate (CER) vs `expected_text` to be ≤ `match.max_cer`
   (default 0.10). OCR is not byte-exact across builds; punctuation/spacing
   drift is fine, a wrong/empty transcript is not. (Think TTS→ASR round-trip
   tolerance.)
5. **Optional diff harness** — if the model declares a `diff` block *and* its
   reference GGUF exists on HF, downloads `<model>-ref.gguf` and runs
   `test-<model>-diff <gguf> <ref>`, asserting every stage's `cos_min` ≥ its
   pinned threshold. If the ref is absent on HF the diff step is **skipped, not
   failed** — diff testing is opt-in by the mere presence of the ref.

A model **passes** only if all applicable checks pass.

## manifest.json

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "match_defaults": { "max_cer": 0.10 },
  "diff_defaults":  { "thresholds": { "*": 0.999 } },
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "got-ocr2",
      "engine": "got-ocr2",
      "gguf": { "repo": "cstr/…-GGUF", "file": "…-q4_k.gguf", "revision": "<sha>" },
      "sample": "tests/regression/images/fox.png",   // local image, OR use sample_hf (below)
      "expected_text": "The quick brown fox …",   // null = not captured yet
      "match": { "max_cer": 0.10 },
      "ocr_args": [],                                // extra CLI flags (optional)
      "diff": {                                      // optional
        "binary": "test-got-ocr-diff",
        "ref": { "repo": "…-GGUF", "file": "…-ref-full.gguf", "revision": "main" },
        "thresholds": { "*": 0.995 }                 // global floor, or per-stage
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`expected_text: null` means "not captured yet" — the key is kept so gaps are
visible. Seed it via the rebake workflow below.

**`sample_hf` (license-restricted fixture images).** When the only in-domain
test image is under a license we can't bundle into this MIT/Apache repo (e.g.
CROHME handwritten-math = CC-BY-NC-SA), replace `sample` with a `sample_hf`
block that extracts one image from an HF **dataset** parquet at test time (like
the GGUFs, the image is fetched from its original source and never committed):

```jsonc
"sample_hf": {
  "dataset": "Kitajiang/test2_CROHME2014",
  "file": "CROHME2014/test-00000-of-00001.parquet",
  "revision": "<commit-sha>",          // PIN it so the row is stable
  "row": 23,                            // integer index into the parquet
  "image_column": "image",
  "label_column": "latex_formula",      // optional sanity gate:
  "expect_label": "\\[C_{t}=C+C=2C\\]"  // fail loudly if the row shifts
}
```

Needs `pandas` in the test env (present on Kaggle + the conda base). Pick a row
the model reads correctly + deterministically (CPU==Metal) so the pinned
`expected_text` is a real guard, and attribute the source dataset in `_comment`.

## Rebake → validate workflow (adding / updating a model)

New models start `expected_text: null`. To capture a proven-correct output:

```bash
# GPU (Kaggle) or a machine with the model downloaded:
python tests/regression/run_one.py --name <model> --rebake
```

`--rebake` prints the captured OCR text instead of asserting. **Eyeball it**,
confirm it's correct, then paste it into `manifest.json` as `expected_text`
(with an `expected_text_source` note: date/commit/backend). Thereafter the
nightly / Kaggle run validates against it.

To enable the exact diff check for a model, dump its reference GGUF
(`tools/dump_<model>_reference.py` → a `-ref.gguf` with the captured stages) and
upload it to the model's HF repo as `<model>-ref.gguf`. The driver picks it up
automatically on the next run.

## Running

```bash
# one model (downloads GGUF from HF into $REGRESSION_WORK)
BUILD_DIR=build python tests/regression/run_one.py --name got-ocr2

# whole portfolio
BUILD_DIR=build python tests/regression/run_one.py --all

# force CPU backend (portable, matches CI)
GOT_OCR_FORCE_CPU=1 BUILD_DIR=build python tests/regression/run_one.py --name got-ocr2
```

Binaries: `crispembed` and `test-*-diff` are found under `$BUILD_DIR`
(override with `CRISPEMBED_BIN` / `DIFF_BIN_DIR`).

## CI (`.github/workflows/regression.yml`)

Tiered, mirroring CrispASR:

- **Tier 0 — smoke** (PR, <2 s, no network/binary): `test_driver_smoke.py`
  validates the manifest schema, the diff parser, the CER/normalisation, and the
  garbage guard. A malformed manifest fails here before anything heavy runs.
- **Tier 1 — preflight** (PR, ~5 s, HF API only): HEAD-check every pinned HF
  artifact the manifest references, so a dead pin is caught without downloading.
- **Tier 2 — full** (nightly / dispatch): build + download + run a CPU-only
  subset of the portfolio end-to-end.

The full GPU portfolio (all models, larger images, timing) runs on Kaggle:
`tools/kaggle/ocr-portfolio-regression/`.

## Design notes

- **Lenient by design.** OCR output varies slightly across builds/backends;
  byte-exact locking (as in CrispASR's ASR transcripts) would be too brittle
  here. The garbage guard + CER threshold + optional exact diff give three
  independent nets at increasing strictness.
- **Diff is opt-in.** We don't require a reference dump for every model to get
  value — the garbage guard + text match already catch the class of bug that
  motivated this suite. Adding a `-ref.gguf` upgrades a model to exact per-layer
  cosine checking.
- **Pin GGUF revisions.** For third-party or re-quantised weights, pin a SHA so
  a silent upstream change doesn't masquerade as a code regression. Our own
  repos may use `"main"` when we want to test current code against current
  shipped weights.
