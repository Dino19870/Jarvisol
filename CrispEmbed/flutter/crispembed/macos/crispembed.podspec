# The pod version doubles as the release tag the prebuilt libs are fetched
# from (see prepare_command below), so a hardcoded literal here silently
# pins every `pod install` to an old release: it sat at 0.16.0 while the
# project shipped 0.17.0/0.17.1/0.17.2, and macOS/iOS kept downloading the
# July libs. Derive it from the plugin's pubspec.yaml — the one file that is
# always shipped next to this podspec, on pub.dev and in a repo checkout
# alike — so bumping the release bumps this automatically.
