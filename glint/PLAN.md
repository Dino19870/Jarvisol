# Quality improvement plan

**Scoreboard** (vs LAME -q2 on identical inputs, after the 2026-07
passes through PLAN items 9/10 and the corpus-driven round of
2026-07-04). 128 kbps joint PEAQ-ODG league over the 10-clip corpus:
glint ahead on 8 (choir −1.28 vs −2.06, orchestral −0.75 vs −1.09,
quartet −0.46 vs −0.88, industrial −0.82 vs −1.00, piano −0.63 vs
−0.70, torture −0.32 vs −0.45, speech −1.24 vs −1.29, electronic
≈tied); LAME ahead on drums (−1.03 vs −1.18) and castanets-ODG (−0.29
vs −0.62) — though castanets mean NMR is now glint's at BOTH rates
(128k −2.1 vs 2.6; 256k −9.7 vs −8.6). 256k: everything transparent
(ODG ≈0), glint ahead on SNR throughout (speech 38.4 vs 36.9,
electronic 44.8/NMR −18.0 vs 44.5/−15.8, quartet 44.9/−13.7 vs
46.0/−11.2). 64k-stereo speech: ODG −3.17 vs −3.32 (glint; PESQ still
LAME's). VBR psy-shaped with gapless playback (Xing + LAME tag,
0-sample decode offset). fixed==double everywhere incl. transients. Castanets (clip REGENERATED 2026-07 —
noise-burst train over a 220 Hz bed, `tests/gen_castanet.py`; harsher
than the old clip, absolute NMRs not comparable to older scoreboards)
128k: mean NMR 8.4 vs LAME 1.2, but **p95 −1.7 vs 2.6 and audible 2.5%
vs 6.2% (glint ahead on both)**; 256k −3.9 vs −8.6. MPEG-2 64k speech
**21.1 vs 17.6 SNR** / NMR 2.4 vs 2.4; m2-64k castanets 15.2/17.8 vs
14.7/16.5. VBR V0: 40.7 dB / NMR −15.3 / 0.0% audible, now with a Xing
header. Stereo speech tiers: 36.7/36.1/36.2 at NMR −8.6/−11.0/−11.1
(normal/best trade ~0.6 dB SNR for NMR vs the target-1.0 era).
**RAM (2026-07-04)**: fixed+GLINT_SMALL_BUFFERS measures ~64 KB (22.6 KB
BSS + ~41.5 KB context after sizing frame buffers for every legal frame
incl. 320 kbps — the earlier 1024-byte cap silently overflowed there)
vs Shine's 95.9 KB — after removing dead
PsychoModel instances (10 KB), replacing the 64 KB cbrt_lut with a
65-float mantissa table under SMALL_BUFFERS (metrics-identical), single-
slotting the per-samplerate mask/window caches (−31 KB) and float
transition tables. The audit also found live memory corruption: VBR's
320 kbps budget frame overflowed the 1024-byte SMALL_BUFFERS assembler —
glint_create now caps/rejects unfittable configs. Desktop builds are
byte-unchanged.
**Remaining LAME gaps** (updated 2026-07-04): speech NMR tail (−13.7 vs
−16.1, in-house metric only — ODG calls speech-128 for glint and PESQ
for LAME; INFORMAL LISTENING 2026-07-04: the maintainer could not tell
glint-128 from LAME-128 on the speech clip, so the model contradiction
is below this listener's audibility threshold — do not spend further
tuning effort on speech-128 metric deltas of this size), the drums/castanets 128k ODG gap (−1.18/−0.62 vs LAME's
−1.03/−0.29 — attack CHARACTER, not bits: detector sensitivity at 4x/6x/8x
identical on drums, an HF-band (subband>=8) detector term fired on piano
hammers and speech consonants instead (ODG −0.63→−0.86 / −1.26→−1.48,
reverted), and banking/mixed-block premises measured out earlier; the
remaining suspects were LAME's pre-echo control and short-window tuning
— also now measured out: tightening pre-attack window masks inside
short granules is a wash (castanets +0.02 ODG, speech −0.02, drums
untouched — drums has only 1.6% shorts and LAME's own block counts are
similar at 2.7%; the drums gap is diffuse psymodel character, not any
single mechanism; investigation closed at diminishing returns),
quartet/piano SNR at 256k
(masked per NMR/ODG). ~~castanets mean NMR~~ — CLOSED 2026-07-04 by the
6x attack threshold: 128k 8.0→−2.1 (LAME 2.6 — glint ahead), 256k
−3.9→−9.7 (LAME −8.6 — glint ahead).
Done in the 2026-07 pass (commit messages have full numbers): outer-loop
shaping target 0.125 = push bands ~9 dB below mask; kShortAttackExtend=2
decay granules; **sfb21 lowpass** (the region has no scalefactor ⇒
unshapeable quantizer spray; zeroing it wins NMR on every clip at every
rate incl. VBR); **short-sfb table fixes** (44.1k boundary 138→136 per
ISO; the m2 tables were MPEG-1 copies — the real cause of the historical
LSF collapse); LSF short blocks live (four-slen groups of 9, START/STOP
region0=54, wire-validated ffmpeg+CoreAudio); m2 long-granule shaping;
preemphasis[20] 3→2 per ISO; **shaping budget = spend + slack/2 and the
anchor EMA tracks pre-shaping rc_gain** (full-budget shaping drained the
reservoir signal and ratcheted the anchor coarse: stereo best −5 dB SNR;
slack·3/4 re-triggers it).
Measured dead ends: shaping guard >1.25 (speech −0.6 dB SNR for +0.3
NMR; short-loop-only 2.0 made castanets WORSE — short masks lack temporal
masking); mixed-frame bit tilt toward the short granule (worse on every
metric); attack-only sfb21 zeroing (keeps p95 win, loses mean win);
transient frames taking the full reservoir + dropped gain floor; reservoir
fill target 60–90% (+0.4 SNR / −0.9 NMR speech). Do NOT shape start/stop
granules (types 1/3): +3 dB NMR.

## 0. ~15 dB SNR ceiling — RESOLVED (pow34 curve bug, fixed on main)

**Root cause:** `fast_pow34` interpolated x^0.75 on an *integer* grid, but
quantizer inputs are fractional MDCT coefficients — on (0,1) it degenerated
to pow34(x)=x, so ix was linear in x and the decoder's ix^(4/3) warped the
spectrum by x^(4/3). Signal-proportional error ⇒ SNR flat vs bitrate. The
scale-search grids (1.3–4.2) and the old "288/194 gain correction" existed to
compensate this curve. Secondary bug fixed too: gain clipping bounds ignored
the scalefactor boost in the quant cache.

**After the fix** (256 kbps speech): SNR 34.5–34.7 dB all tiers (was
12.5–14.7), seg-SNR 37.4, LSD 6.7, mean NMR −8.6 dB / 1.9% audible, rolloff
= source. Music: electronic 29.2 dB, quartet 27.2 dB. A 441 Hz sine: 79 dB.
LAME on the same clips: 36.9/44.5/46.0 SNR, NMR −16/−15.8/−11.1 — glint is
now in the same league, ~2–15 dB behind depending on content.

**Follow-ups opened by the fix:**
- The tiers barely differ now (34.51/34.55/34.69) — the extra `-q best`
  machinery was compensation. Re-differentiate the tiers with real work
  (items 3/5).
- `kNmrOuterLoop` and `kGranuleRedistribution` disabled — both regressed
  post-fix (−0.7 / −1.9 dB); re-tune to the new noise floor before
  re-enabling.
- `fast_pow34` is now plain `std::pow` — restore a fast path (frexp-based
  mantissa table) if profiling shows it hot; encode times were unchanged.
- ~~VBR mis-calibrated post-fix~~ — done, see item 8.
- White-noise pathology: full-scale white noise decodes +11 dB hot and
  clipped (pre-existing; LAME also only manages 10 dB here). Suspect the
  +0.4054 rounding bias at ultra-coarse quantization when the 4095-bit cap
  binds, times the scale search. Edge case, but worth a look with item 5.
- ~~Re-tune envelope penalty~~ — measured obsolete post-fix and removed
  (granule_mse is pure reconstruction MSE now); `-q speed` skips the scale
  search entirely (f=1.0 always won). The 45/55 channel-split clamp holds on
  the music clips.

### Original diagnosis (kept for the record)

Measured on identical inputs at 256 kbps CBR (LAME via ffmpeg libmp3lame,
`tests/measure_audio.py`, NMR metric):

| clip (60 s, 44.1k stereo) | metric | LAME | glint `-q best` |
|---|---|---|---|
| speech ref | SNR / LSD / mean NMR | 36.9 / 4.6 / **−16.1** | 14.9 / 12.0 / **+5.1** |
| electronic (bass-heavy) | SNR / mean NMR | 44.5 / −15.8 | 14.7 / +6.3 |
| string quartet | SNR / mean NMR | 46.0 / −11.1 | 14.2 / +5.3 |

256 kbps stereo should be near-transparent; glint plateaus ~14-15 dB SNR on
every content type while spending the same bits. This is structural, not
tuning. Diagnostic signatures to chase:
- **Mid-band starvation**: bandSNR 1-4 kHz is 3.5-8 dB on music (LAME: 24)
  even though little total error power sits there — the 1-4k content is
  simply gone. Rolloff on the quartet: 603 Hz vs 1141 Hz source; on speech
  it's fine (tuned there). The envelope-retention penalty and scale search
  were tuned on speech and do not generalize.
- **Noise placement is inverted vs LAME**: glint puts 64-85% of error power
  in 0-1 kHz; LAME pushes ~50% above 8 kHz where masking absorbs it.
- **`-q speed` collapses on bass-heavy content**: 6.7 dB SNR (electronic).
- The per-granule input-scale search (factors 1.0-4.2) reconstructs ≈ f·x
  and relies on dead-zone down-bias to land near the right level — check
  whether a systematic MDCT/quantizer normalization mismatch is being
  papered over by the factor search; if so small coefficients die in the
  dead zone by construction and no amount of scalefactor work will fix it.
- Check per-granule budget utilization (sum part2_3_length vs
  available_bits): if utilization is high, the bits are being spent on the
  wrong things (huge low-band ix values?); if low, the gain search is
  leaving budget on the table.

Prioritized quality (not speed) work. Anchor facts from the 256 kbps speech
measurements: 65–74% of all error power sits in 0–1 kHz, and several standard
MP3 bitstream tools are unused (`preflag`/`scalefac_scale` never set, Huffman
tables chosen by max-value only, M/S all-or-nothing with a fixed 50/50 channel
bit split).

Gate for every item: `tests/measure_audio.py` on the canonical speech clip
(SNR/seg-SNR/LSD/rolloff/centroid must improve or hold), `ffmpeg` backstep
check (zero), unit tests, `fixed` path metrics match `double`. (The two
signal paths have never been byte-identical to each other; "double==fixed" in
the docs means metrics-identical.) Quality changes are *not* byte-identical
to the previous main by design — that's what the metrics gate is for.

## 1. Real Huffman table selection — DONE (merged)

`choose_huff_table` picked one fixed table per max-value class (always 7 never
8/9, always 10 never 11/12, always 13 never 15, first ESC table with enough
linbits, never the 24–31 family). Count actual bits for every candidate in
the same-range group and pick the minimum. Hot path uses a fused
`huffman_select_and_count` (one pass accumulates all candidate totals; the
running minimum keeps the bit_limit early exit exact) — the naive version
cost +22–40% encode time, the fused one +5–7%. Every saved bit lets the gain
search land on a finer global_gain at the same bitrate.
Measured (speech, 256 kbps): SNR +0.01..0.03 dB, seg-SNR +0.01..0.04 dB,
LSD −0.5 dB at all tiers, rolloff +23/+70 Hz (normal/best).

## 2. Smarter bit distribution — DONE (merged)

- Per-granule channel bit split proportional to post-transform energy,
  clamped to **45–55%** (`kChSplitLo/Hi` in encoder.cpp), integer-exact (the
  shares sum to the old 50/50 total). Was a fixed 50/50.
  Measured (speech, 256 kbps, vs post-#1): joint speed +0.13 dB SNR /
  LSD −0.96; joint normal +0.03 / −0.40; joint best −0.01 / −0.37 with
  seg-SNR +0.02; stereo +0.03..0.05 dB SNR at all tiers.
  **Clamp tuning matters**: 25/75 regressed joint best SNR by 1.5 dB (side
  channel starved in loud passages — its error adds directly to decoded L/R
  even when mid-band metrics improve); 42/58 still −0.09 dB. 45/55 is the
  everything-improves-or-holds point on the speech clip. Re-tune with real
  wide-stereo music before trusting it beyond speech.
- Inter-granule redistribution now uses both channels' energy (was ch 0
  only). Extending it from best-only to normal was measured and regressed
  (joint normal −0.05 dB SNR, seg-SNR and LSD worse), so it stays best-only
  with the 30/70 clamp.
- Music check (electronic + string quartet, see item 0): joint ≈ stereo on
  both clips, so the 45/55 clamp holds up beyond speech.

## 3. Outer-loop noise shaping — REBUILT as psy allocation (merged); see commit
`quality: psychoacoustic bit allocation`. Schroeder-Bark masks aligned with
the metric, Σ(noise/mask) objective, seedless start, side-channel excluded,
+9% encode time at best. The section below describes the FIRST version and
its lessons; superseded.

### First version (historical)

`nmr_outer_loop` in quantize.cpp: amplify scalefactors of bands whose
reconstruction noise exceeds a per-band mask, re-run the gain search so
global_gain coarsens to pay (the mechanism both failed branches lacked —
they kept the gain fixed), keep the best iterate by (bands-over-mask,
log-excess), ≤10 iterations, MPEG-1 long blocks.
Measured: best-tier SNR +0.09/+0.10 dB (stereo/joint), seg-SNR +0.07,
mean NMR 5.12 → 5.06 dB. Cost +64% encode time at best.

**Learned the hard way:**
- The `psycho.cpp` model is unusable as an allocation target: 1.5–3 dB/Bark
  slopes + excluded self-masking let one loud band "mask" the whole
  spectrum; scoring with it drove SNR to −4 dB (HF polished, low bands
  destroyed). The loop uses its own masks (−20 dB self SMR, 15 dB/band
  spreading, ATH floor).
- A total-noise guard (≤1.15× the start's noise) is load-bearing: the loop
  may redistribute noise, never grow it. Loosening to 1.3× changed nothing —
  the loop exits via convergence, not the guard, once masks are sane.
- At `-q normal` the loop finds nothing the guard allows (2× cost, zero
  gain) — it stays best-only; speed/normal remain byte-identical.

**Still open here:** `scalefac_scale=1` when sf range is too narrow,
`preflag` for the HF preemphasis pattern, fixing the perceptual inversion in
the CBR energy-based scalefactor seed (loud bands get extra precision —
backwards), and making the loop pay off at `-q normal`.

## 4. Perceptual scale-search objective — TODO (pairs with 3)

`granule_mse` optimizes raw MSE + envelope-retention heuristic. Weight
per-band noise by the masking threshold (minimize NMR, not MSE) using the same
search machinery. Needs metric support (see 6) to evaluate honestly.

## 5. Bit reservoir + rate control — DONE (merged); short blocks still TODO

**Reservoir + rate control (merged):** the ReservoirStream mechanism
(continuous main-data stream, deferred frame emission, `finish_frame` unifies
both encode paths' emission) plus a buffer-feedback constant-quality
controller: each CBR frame may spend slot + reservoir (capped at one extra
slot), a per-frame gain floor (`rc_anchor`) stops gold-plating on easy
frames, and the anchor adapts ±1 gain step/frame from reservoir fill,
tethered to an EMA of achieved gains. Gains vs no-reservoir: speech 256k
joint 35.1 → 37.3 dB (now above LAME 256k's 36.9 on this clip), 128k +2.5,
96k +2.6, electronic 256k 39.7 → 43.2, quartet 44.4 → 45.2, m2-64k
18.8 → 20.8 (LAME: 17.6). Soft spot: stereo-speech mean NMR eased
−8.8 → −7.2 while SNR rose; consider an NMR-aware anchor.

**Short blocks — DONE for MPEG-1 (merged).** The blocker was a
region-layout bug: window-switching side info has no region counts and only
two table_selects (decoder hardwires region1 = [36, big_values·2)), but the
encoder computed region1_end = 44 from the long-sfb tables and encoded
everything past it as region2 with table 0 — which writes *nothing*. Every
coefficient above wire index 44 was silently dropped while decoders kept
reading. With the `window_switching` flag in HuffRegions forcing the
decoder's boundaries, an all-short sine encodes at 80.7 dB (long path: 79).
The forward transforms (long/start/short/stop windows, both MDCTs, TDAC
across every transition) were proven exact with a Python
perfect-reconstruction harness first — the math was never the problem.

Landed with it: START/STOP transition windows in the MDCT, a per-frame
window scheduler (shared across channels, as M/S requires), and a
**one-granule encoder lookahead** (last granule held back; glint_flush
releases it, +576 samples latency) so a START always precedes the transient.
Castanets at 256k: mean NMR 17.5 → −0.2 dB (noise at the masking threshold);
at 128k: 28.9 → 10.7 (LAME: 4.8 — remaining gap is bits). SNR drops on
transients by design (LAME shows the same signature); judge by NMR. Steady
content within 0.4 dB at unchanged NMR.

**Still open here:** (all resolved since)
- ~~MPEG-2/LSF short blocks~~ — DONE. The historical 20.8 → 8.6 dB collapse
  was the sfb_short_table_m2 being an MPEG-1 copy (reorder scrambled vs
  every real decoder), NOT the scalefac_compress semantics. With the ISO
  tables, the four-slen LSF field encoding (groups of 3 bands × 3 windows,
  9 values each), scalefac_s emission, and the START/STOP region0_end=54
  boundary (ffmpeg init_short_region), m2-64k speech measures 21.1 dB /
  NMR 1.40 (LAME 17.6 / 2.38) and castanets NMR 36.3 → 17.6.
  Wire-validated on ffmpeg + CoreAudio (identical metrics).
- ~~Short-block scalefactors / subblock_gain~~ — done earlier.
- ~~128k castanet gap~~ — attacked via kShortAttackExtend=2 + sfb21
  lowpass + the 44.1k short-table fix (see scoreboard).
- `GLINT_FORCE_SHORT=1` forces all-short for diagnostics.

## 6c. Test clips — canonical set (extended 2026-07-04)

Two higher-quality lossless clips added (the electronic/quartet sources
are dark — rolloff 474/1141 Hz):
- `03_music_industrial_60s.wav` — NIN "19 Ghosts III" 60-120s, from the
  official 24bit/48k ALAC on archive.org (NineInchNailsGhostsI-Iv24bit48khz,
  CC BY-NC-SA 3.0); broadband to ~17 kHz, dense production. First
  standings: glint-128 ahead of LAME on everything (NMR −1.9 vs 0.0,
  audible 18 vs 31%, ODG −0.80 vs −1.00).
- `04_music_piano_60s.wav` — Kimiko Ishizaka, Open Goldberg Variations
  Var. 1 (OpenGoldbergVariations on archive.org, CC0, 24bit/96k FLAC).
  First standings: LAME slightly ahead at 128k (audible 1.4 vs 5.5%,
  ODG −0.70 vs −0.79) — a NEW measured weakness worth chasing.
Sources kept alongside as ghosts19_src.m4a / goldberg_var1_src.flac.
Corpus extended to 10 clips (2026-07-04, user request): additionally
- `05_music_orchestral_60s.wav` — Beethoven Eroica mvt 1 (Musopen
  `MusopenCollectionAsFlac`, PD mark, 24/48 FLAC), full orchestra.
- `06_music_drums_60s.wav` — NIN "22 Ghosts III" (same CC BY-NC-SA
  item), drum-forward.
- `07_music_choir_60s.wav` — The Tudor Consort, Animuccia Credo
  (archive.org, CC BY 3.0, 16/44.1 FLAC), a cappella polyphony.
- `08_torture_60s.wav` — deterministic synthetic (tests/gen_torture.py):
  log sweep, AM multitone, glockenspiel-like bursts, stepped band noise.
For more material: archive.org lossless items are the reliable pool
(Pixabay/FMA serve lossy MP3 downloads — unusable as codec references);
EBU SQAM is now behind an EBU login; Jamendo offers FLAC for CC tracks.

## 6b. Encoder league table — tests/compare_encoders.py (2026-07)

Automated comparison harness: encodes every clip with glint
(speed/normal/best), LAME (`lame -q2`/`-q0`), and Shine (`shineenc`,
build from github.com/toots/shine — fixed-point, no psymodel: a floor
baseline), decodes via ffmpeg, reports SNR/seg-SNR/NMR (+PESQ-WB and
STOI via pip `pesq`/`pystoi` for speech clips) and encode speed.
Standings at 2026-07 (CBR, joint):
- Music: glint ahead or tied at BOTH rates — electronic-128 decisively
  (NMR −6.3 vs LAME −3.1, audible 5.4% vs 16%), electronic-256 tied
  (−16.0 vs −16.1), quartet-128 −3.8 vs −2.0, quartet-256 −14.0 vs −11.2.
- Speech-256: LAME ahead on NMR (−15.5 vs −13.8), PESQ saturated/tied
  (4.62-4.64), glint ahead on SNR (38.0 vs 35.9).
- Speech-128: glint ahead on NMR (−2.9 vs −2.2) and audible (14% vs 20%)
  BUT **PESQ prefers LAME (4.57 vs 4.43)** — the first independent
  perceptual model disagreeing with our NMR ranking. Our NMR metric and
  the encoder share the mask model, so it is partially self-confirming;
  treat low-rate speech tuning wins as unproven until PESQ agrees.
  (PESQ is only discriminative below ~192k; at 256k everything including
  Shine scores 4.6.)
- Shine: 10-20 dB below everyone everywhere (psymodel-free floor ✓).
- glint-speed on quartet-128 (NMR −0.8 vs normal's −3.8) shows what the
  psy shaping buys.
Extended 2026-07: PEAQ basic-model ODG for every clip via peaqb-fast
(github.com/akinori-ito/peaqb-fast, plain autotools; peaqb does NOT
time-align, the harness feeds it an aligned 48 kHz 20 s pair or every
score saturates at −4), ViSQOL MOS-LQO via the Rust port
(`cargo install visqol`, fullband mode with google/visqol's libsvm
model file — the upstream bazel build no longer compiles against
current Xcode SDKs: bazel 5's crosstool aborts, bazel 6 removed the
platforms API its 2022 TF pin needs, and the cpp-only toolchain trips
over TF's zlib on the macOS 26 SDK), and a `--mode mono` ladder.
The tools live PERSISTENTLY in ~/code/glint-tools/ (peaqb-fast/, shine/
— static-built with --disable-shared, visqol-model/); the visqol binary
itself is ~/.cargo/bin/visqol. The harness defaults point there.
**Treat ViSQOL with caution on these clips**: it ranks Shine (audibly
the worst encoder by every other measure, NMR −3 vs −14) ABOVE glint
and LAME on quartet-256 (4.67 vs 4.38/4.63) and above glint on
electronic-256 — its fullband SVR model appears insensitive to MP3's
actual artifact classes here. ODG (PEAQ) and PESQ remain the trusted
external models; keep MOS as a gross-artifact tripwire only.
Mono-64k speech ladder standings: LAME ahead on BOTH perceptual models
(ODG −2.47 vs glint-normal −2.94, PESQ 4.44 vs 4.22) while glint wins
SNR/NMR — consistent with the 128k PESQ finding: below ~128k, speech
tuning wins measured only by our NMR are not to be trusted. At 96k
mono it's mixed (glint edges ODG −1.70 vs −1.74, LAME PESQ 4.58 vs
4.50).
Full joint table with ODG (2026-07): the perceptual models sharpen the
map. Quartet: glint clearly ahead on EVERY model (128k ODG −0.44 vs
LAME −0.88; 256k 0.02 vs −0.06). Electronic-128: our NMR says glint
decisively (−6.3 vs −3.1) but ODG gives LAME a slight edge (−0.22 vs
−0.31) — treat the electronic-128 NMR lead cautiously. Speech-128: the
two perceptual models DISAGREE with each other (ODG prefers glint
−1.24 vs −1.29; PESQ prefers LAME 4.57 vs 4.43) — call it a tie.
Castanets: LAME ahead perceptually at both rates (128k ODG −0.29 vs
−0.63) — glint's p95/audible-% advantages do not carry over to ODG,
so the castanets mean-NMR gap is the perceptually honest signal there.
256k everything-transparent (all ODG ~0). glint-speed's missing short
blocks show up as ODG −3.33 on castanets-128 (vs normal's −0.63).

## 6. Perceptual measurement — DONE (NMR in measure_audio.py, merged)

`nmr_metrics` in `tests/measure_audio.py`: Bark-band noise-to-mask with
Schroeder spreading, −14 dB offset, ATH-shaped floor calibrated ~96 dB below
the loudest band-frame. Reports mean/p95 NMR and % band-frames over mask.
Ranks tiers correctly (speed 6.6 > normal 5.3 > best 5.1 dB mean at
256 kbps). Calibration is relative — compare builds on the same reference.
Still open: ViSQOL/PEAQ for a MOS-like score; A/B against LAME at 256 kbps.

## 7. MPEG-2/2.5 path — FIXED (merged)

Root cause was an invented `scalefac_compress` mapping
(sfc = slen0·36 + slen1·6 + slen2), internally consistent between glint's
encode and emission but not ISO 13818-3 — every real decoder derived
different slens and misparsed the granule (−10 dB SNR garbage,
long-standing). Both sides now use the standard sfc<400 mapping.
Result: CBR-64k at 22.05 kHz measures 18.8 dB SNR (LAME 64k: 17.6 —
glint ahead), VBR V4 31.5 dB, 0 backstep.

**Bonus find while fixing:** the quantizer band loop read `scalefac[21]`
out of bounds for the sfb21 region (bins ≥ sfb[21], ~9 kHz+ at 44.1k) —
aliasing scalefac_compress as a phantom ~29× boost with no decoder-side
compensation. Fixing it (sfb21 has no scalefactor, period) was worth
+0.3 dB/−1.4 LSD on speech and **+8 to +17 dB SNR on music**:
electronic 29.2 → 39.7, quartet 27.2 → 44.4 dB (LAME: 44.5/46.0).
Follow-up: add a decode-based m2 test — the unit suite never caught any
of this.

## 8. VBR — DONE (merged), MPEG-1 and MPEG-2

Real variable-size frames (smallest bitrate index that fits), unified with
the CBR quantizer path via a gain floor, target-gain table recalibrated
post-pow34-fix, and two budget bugs fixed (VBR quantized under the caller's
default 128k frame budget instead of the max; and budgets assumed the CBR
padding byte, overflowing the largest unpadded frame ~2×/min). Speech
ladder: V0 319 kbps / 39.2 dB / NMR −13.4 → V9 53 kbps / 23.3 dB; MPEG-2
V4 at 22.05k: 31.5 dB. Follow-up: write a Xing/VBRI header so players show
correct duration/seek for VBR files.

## Smaller dials (experiment-sized)

(Absorbed into the follow-up queue below.)

## 9. Follow-up queue (2026-07, prioritized)

Work these in order; record measured results (or dead-end learnings) per
item, in place. Gate: the standard battery (speech + music + castanets +
m2, joint/stereo, CBR/VBR), 0 backstep, unit tests, double==fixed metrics.

1. **Decode-based m2 regression test** — DONE. `test_m2_decode` in
   tests/test_quality.py (also `--m2-only`), registered in ctest as
   `m2_decode_quality` when python3+numpy and ffmpeg exist (~3 s, FFT
   alignment). Three cases at 22.05k: CBR-64k best (21.5 dB), forced
   all-short (22.7 dB — pins the LSF short wire format), VBR V4
   (24.9 dB); floors 16/16/18. Verified discriminative: re-breaking the
   22.05k short-sfb table drops allshort to 11.4 dB -> FAIL. Note the
   test passes `-p double` explicitly — the CLI default is the FIXED
   path, which has no short blocks.
2. **Adaptive rounding offset** — DEAD END (measured 2026-07). Global
   sweep (0.30/0.4054/0.50, 256k best): 0.4054 wins or ties on speech
   joint+stereo, quartet, castanets — the per-granule factor search
   already owns the level dimension. Per-granule offset candidates
   {0.30, 0.50} at the winning factor, picked by granule_mse: speech
   joint NMR −13.48→−13.36 (worse), stereo/castanets marginally worse,
   quartet ≈, at +2 quantize_base runs/granule. MSE cannot see what the
   NMR metric penalizes here. Reverted; per-BAND offsets (LAME's actual
   trick is tonality-dependent) would need a tonality estimate first.
3. **Per-band-frame outlier control** — DEAD END (measured 2026-07).
   Two alternative outer-loop objectives tried: Σlog(max(r, target))
   (matches the metric's mean-dB) and Σmax(r−target, 0) (audible-excess
   only). Log objective: castanets-128k mean 8.37→7.99 but everything
   else a hair WORSE (elec −15.92→−15.87, quartet −13.87→−13.81, m2
   speech 2.50→2.59, stereo SNR −0.07); excess objective: pure no-op.
   The castanets mean outliers are attack-frame-local — there the noise
   guard and shaping budget bind, not the objective's shape. Reverted.
4. **Xing/VBRI header for VBR** — DONE. VBR streams start with a silent
   placeholder frame (64 kbps-index size); `glint_vbr_header()` (public
   API, call after glint_flush) produces the finalized Xing frame —
   frames, bytes, 100-point TOC (up to 256 stored offsets with stride
   doubling, fixed memory) — and the CLI rewrites frame 0 with it.
   ffprobe now reports exact duration and true average bitrate (V0
   318.7k / V9 46k); streaming consumers that cannot seek get ~26 ms of
   leading silence instead of a bogus header. Metrics unchanged.
5. **Perceptual scale-search objective (old item 4)** — DEAD END
   (measured 2026-07, as the envelope-penalty history predicted).
   Weighting granule_mse per band by 1/mask (same masks as the outer
   loop): NMR improves only marginally (speech −13.48→−13.61, elec
   −15.92→−16.02) while SNR collapses — quartet 44.7→36.9 (−7.7 dB!),
   speech 37.7→35.4, 0-1k band-SNR −8 dB. The mask-relative objective
   happily degrades loud (self-masked) low bands for slivers of NMR;
   the outer loop already harvests those trades SAFELY because its
   total-noise guard bounds the damage — the factor search has no such
   guard. Raw MSE stays the factor-search objective. Reverted.
6. **Per-frame M/S vs L/R decision** — DEAD END as tried (2026-07).
   Energy-skew criterion (pick the representation concentrating more
   energy, letting the 45/55 bit split starve the cheap channel):
   regressions wherever it switched to L/R — quartet-256k 44.7→42.5 dB /
   NMR −13.9→−11.0, speech −13.5→−12.6; electronic never switched
   (identical). The test set has no truly decorrelated wide-stereo clip,
   so the upside is unmeasurable here while the criterion's mistakes are
   expensive. Revisit only with (a) a real wide-stereo test clip and
   (b) a trial-encode decision (quantize both ways, compare NMR), not an
   energy heuristic. Reverted.
7. **Region boundary search** — DONE (merged). `huffman_optimize_regions`
   enumerates all valid (region0_count, region1_count) splits over
   per-table prefix bit costs on the FINISHED granule (`polish_regions`
   at the end of quantize_granule/_vbr; the gain search keeps the cheap
   heuristic). Saved bits shrink part2_3_length and feed the reservoir:
   speech-256k joint **+0.31 dB SNR / NMR −13.48→−13.77**, stereo
   +0.34/−11.05, quartet 44.87/−14.01, m2-64k 21.06/2.41, VBR V4 −1.4%
   bytes at identical quality; electronic/castanets hold. 0 backstep,
   ffmpeg+CoreAudio validated.
8. **NMR-driven VBR allocation** — DEAD END as designed (2026-07).
   Per-granule floor = coarsest gain whose analytic band noise stays
   within mask*offset(V) (offset −9 dB at V0 … +18 dB at V9, binary
   search, pow34 precomputed). Result: NOT more efficient — at V4 it
   spends +15% bytes for better NMR, but the fixed table interpolated to
   EQUAL bytes still wins (quartet: table-V0 2399 kB/−15.6 vs psy-V4
   2385 kB/−15.0); at V9 the permissive offset drives the floor to gain
   ~220 and output collapses to near-silence. The fixed table + frame
   budget feedback is the better allocator; a real win would need the
   full outer-loop shaping in the VBR path (it currently has none), not
   a smarter floor. Reverted.
9. **White-noise pathology** — RESOLVED by earlier fixes / explained
   (2026-07). The "+11 dB hot and clipped" behavior no longer exists
   (killed by the pow34-curve and gain-clipping-bound fixes). Current
   full-scale white noise: raw SNR −2.4 dB looks alarming but decomposes
   into (a) the sfb21 lowpass deleting the ~28% of white-noise energy
   above 15.8 kHz — a structural corr ceiling of √0.72 ≈ 0.85, measured
   0.84, with per-band coherence 0.99 everywhere below the cutoff — and
   (b) a −1.6 dB level bias from the dead zone at ultra-coarse gains.
   Level- and bitrate-independent by construction. LAME measures 8.9 dB
   via its 17.5k lowpass + exact level. Not a defect worth machinery;
   revisit only if the level bias shows up on real content.
10. **fast_pow34 fast path** — NOT NEEDED (profiled 2026-07, macOS
    `sample` on -q best speech): std::pow is absent from the flat
    profile; exp2 (pow's backend plus the mask model's pow10) totals
    ~1.3%. The heat is in huffman_select_and_count / quantize_and_count
    / gain_search (~55%) as pass 3 found. No fast path.
11. **Speed re-measure + docs** — DONE. Interleaved A/B vs pre-pass
    main (2de393e) initially showed the quality pass cost
    +59%/+81%/+58% (speed/normal/best). Recouped (metrics-neutral,
    committed as PLAN 9.11): lazy per-table prefix memoization + suffix
    cost sharing in huffman_optimize_regions (byte-identical), no region
    polish at -q speed (was ~30% of that tier's profile), and a 3-stall
    early exit in both NMR outer loops (metrics identical ±0.01 dB).
    Final: speed +1.8%, normal +60%, best +33% vs pre-pass — the
    remainder is the shape-below-mask iterations themselves. Absolutes
    (M1, moderate load): ~260×/52×/34× realtime. README refreshed.

Not queued: ViSQOL/PEAQ (needs external tooling — since done, §6b),
~~sfb21 partial-keep at high rates~~ (DONE 2026-07-04: content-aware
keep at >96 kbps/ch for LONG granules outside a post-transient window —
share>1e-3 of granule energy above the cut keeps it. Torture-sweep SNR
17.5→33.8 / ODG −0.45→−0.16, quartet ODG 0.02→0.08; castanets exactly
unchanged — keeping burst/decay HF re-created attack spray, hence the
block-type + transient-context gates), mode-dependent shaping target
for stereo (only if a stereo-SNR use case shows up).

## 10. Second follow-up queue (2026-07-04, prioritized)

Grounded in the league-table findings (PESQ+ODG both confirm the low-rate
speech gap; ODG confirms the castanets mean gap; ViSQOL is a tripwire
only). Gate: the standard battery PLUS — for anything targeting ≤128k
speech — PESQ and ODG must improve or hold; our in-house NMR alone is not
sufficient there (it shares the encoder's mask model).

1. **Bitrate-scaled lowpass** — DONE (merged). Cutoff by per-channel
   kbps (anchors PESQ/ODG-calibrated: 32/ch→9500 Hz, 48/ch→11000;
   ≥64/ch keeps the sfb21 band — a 12-13.5k cut there helped speech
   mildly but hurt music ODG), resolved once in glint_create to
   long/short wire start indices, snapping to the sample rate's sfb
   grid. 64k-stereo speech: ODG −3.76→−3.17 (LAME −3.32 — glint now
   AHEAD on ODG), PESQ 3.68→4.01 (LAME 4.21), audible 45→41%;
   96k-stereo: ODG −2.68→−2.45, PESQ 4.21→4.34, audible 30→22%.
   128k/256k outputs byte-identical (cut==sfb21 there); mono-64
   unchanged BY DESIGN (LAME also keeps ~full band at 64 kbps/ch — its
   remaining mono-64 PESQ lead is not bandwidth). Discovered en route:
   LAME's own low-rate lever is RESAMPLING (64k stereo → 24 kHz LSF,
   96k → 32 kHz); an auto-resample would be a CLI-level feature.
2. **Tonality-adaptive mask offset** — RESURRECTED and merged
   (2026-07-04), rate-gated. First measured as a dead end — but only
   because the ORIGINAL clips had no strongly tonal content. On the
   extended corpus it wins exactly where theory says: piano-128 ODG
   −0.79→−0.63 (overtaking LAME's −0.70), audible 5.5→3.3%; drums-128
   ODG −1.31→−1.18; quartet-256 +0.4 dB SNR. Elsewhere ≤±0.03 ODG, but
   it costs ~1 dB of in-house NMR at 256k (metric mismatch — our NMR
   uses the flat −14 dB offset) where everything is transparent anyway.
   Enabled at ≤96 kbps/channel (128k stereo/joint and below), same
   philosophy as the lowpass gate; 256k outputs unchanged. LESSON: a
   "dead end" verdict is only as good as the test corpus.
3. **Attack bit banking** — repurposed into a WIN (merged as
   post-transient reservoir banking). The original goal is dead: on
   castanets the trivial inter-burst bed keeps the reservoir AT CAP
   before every attack (banking variants were bit-identical), so the
   castanets mean gap is definitively NOT a bits-at-attack problem —
   scratch lookahead extension for that purpose. But the mechanism
   (fill target 70-90% + anchor clamp ema+24 for ~0.7 s after any
   short-block frame) is a measured win wherever transients neighbor
   hard content: electronic-256 NMR −15.9→−18.0 (now clearly ahead of
   LAME's −16.1) at +1.26 dB SNR, electronic-128 +1.41 dB / NMR −0.85,
   speech-128 +0.62 dB / audible 14.1→13.3%, speech-256 +0.43 dB.
   Quartet/castanets bit-identical (state never triggers / no
   headroom). Enabled by default — JOINT MODE ONLY: the final stereo
   canonical run caught −1.0 dB SNR / −1.15 NMR in plain stereo, where
   no unshaped side channel funds the forced-saving regime (softer
   variants — fill-gated, hold-only — either kept the stereo damage or
   eroded the joint wins). Stereo keeps baseline rate control and its
   pre-banking numbers exactly.
4. **VBR psy shaping** — DONE (merged). quantize_granule_vbr now routes
   through the full quantize_granule (factor search + NMR loops + region
   polish) at the VBR gain floor, with a VBR-specific shaping budget of
   unshaped-spend × 1.25 — CBR's spend+slack/2 formula let V9 frames
   balloon 2.4× under the max-rate budget. Bytes-honest results (48k
   basis A/B): V0 speech NMR −15.34→−15.90 at equal size; V4 speech
   +4.4% bytes for NMR −10.92→−13.50 (the old ladder interpolated to
   equal bytes gives only ≈−11.7) with ODG −0.10→+0.07; V9 +6.5% bytes,
   audible 60.5→57.9%; quartet V4 +10% bytes for NMR −2.1→−14.8. The
   M/S side channel stays excluded (allow_psy threaded through).
5. **Gapless LAME tag** — DONE (merged). The finalized Xing frame now
   carries a LAME info-tag extension ("LAMEglint" version — must start
   with "LAME" for ffmpeg to honor it; delay=1104 double path / 528
   fixed, matching the measured 1633-sample total minus the decoder's
   529; end padding 0 — unknowable in a streaming encoder; info-tag
   CRC-16 over the first 190 bytes for foobar2000). ffmpeg now decodes
   VBR output with a 0-sample alignment offset (was ~2785 incl. the
   placeholder frame). CBR files carry no Xing/Info frame at all —
   adding an "Info" frame for CBR gapless is a possible follow-up.
6. **CI (GitHub Actions)** — TODO. Build matrix (double/fixed/both) +
   ctest incl. the m2 decode test (ffmpeg installs in runners). The wire
   -format history is the argument.
7. **League regression gate** — TODO. compare_encoders.py --check mode
   with recorded per-clip baselines and thresholds, wired for nightly CI.
8. **ABX script** — TODO. Small terminal ABX tool for the model-contested
   cases (speech-128, electronic-128).
9. **Fixed-point short blocks** — DONE (merged). The fixed path now has
   the one-granule lookahead (held_sub_fp), the shared window scheduler,
   and short/start/stop transforms: MDCT_FP::process_short_and_convert
   plus a transition-window branch in process_and_convert, both running
   Q24→double + double window/cos math — the quantizer downstream is
   double anyway and those granules are rare; the hot LONG path keeps
   its byte-stable integer transform. reorder/scheduler helpers moved
   out of the double-only guard; glint_flush releases the fixed held
   granule; the gapless delay is 1104 for both paths now. Metrics:
   fixed==double to ≤0.06 dB on every config INCLUDING castanets (the
   fixed path previously had no shorts at all) and m2-64k. 28/28 +
   16/16 tests, 0 backstep, full quality suite green on --fixed.
10. **Psy-loop noise caching** — DEAD END as planned (2026-07). The
    -q normal profile shows compute_band_noise at 2% — caching it is
    pointless. The psy loop's real cost is its per-iteration gain
    re-searches (select_and_count + quantize_and_count ≈ 52% of the
    tier), already LUT-optimal since perf pass 3. A warm-started binary
    search (lower bound seeded from the previous iterate's gain, -4
    margin) was metrics-identical but measured 0% faster — the probe
    count barely shrinks and probe cost concentrates near the answer.
    Reverted. The remaining normal-tier cost is inherent to shaping;
    next real lever would be evaluating candidates on the thread pool
    (the -j machinery), not caching.
11. **Mixed blocks** — DESCOPED on evidence (2026-07). The feature buys
    LF resolution during short-block frames, but glint's castanets-128k
    0-1k band-SNR is already 31.8 dB vs LAME's 24.9 — 7 dB AHEAD in
    exactly the region mixed blocks improve (subblock_gain + short
    scalefactors cover it). The remaining perceptual gap (ODG −0.63 vs
    −0.29) is not an LF problem, so the largest wire-format surface in
    the format (per-subband window chains, dual scalefactor layout,
    switch_point regions) would target a non-problem. Revisit only if a
    clip ever shows an LF-during-transients deficit.
12. **Intensity stereo / ABR** — not attempted (the queue's measured
    priorities ran out before them; intensity stereo only matters below
    the rates glint targets, ABR is a rate-control mode without a user).

## 13. MP3 no-FPU integer -q speed path — DONE (2026-07-06), GLINT_MP3_INT

Honest finding that triggered this: the MP3 "fixed" path was Q31 only
through the SUBBAND analysis — the 36-pt MDCT converts Q24->double and
the whole rate loop is double, so the old "no FPU" README claim really
meant "runs via soft-float". GLINT_MODE=fixed now also defines
GLINT_MP3_INT, making the -q speed CBR chain integer per-coefficient
end-to-end (subband Q31 -> int freq-inversion -> NEW integer 36-pt MDCT
(Q31 fused win*cos/288 table, int64 accumulation) -> existing integer
alias reduction -> int sfb21 lowpass (same adaptive content-keep rule,
int64 energies) -> log-domain integer quantizer (shared intmath.hpp Q16
log2/exp2 LUTs; MP3's gain step is exactly 12288 in Q16, the same
constant as AAC's sf step) -> the already-integer Huffman/bitstream).
Per-frame scalars (rate control, gain bounds) remain double = fine on
soft-float. The transient scheduler is quality>=1 only, so no
per-sample double sneaks in at speed.

Gates: -q speed metrics IDENTICAL to the old fixed build within
0.01-0.02 dB on every measure (128k/256k MPEG-1 and 64k MPEG-2), 0
backstep; normal/best/VBR and the double path BYTE-IDENTICAL
(untouched); all ctest suites green. M1 wall time unchanged (its FPU
made doubles free — the win is RP2040-class soft-float targets).
Scope note: -q speed + CBR only; normal/best (psy loops) and VBR keep
double math by design. intmath.hpp refactor left AAC INT output
byte-identical.

# Vorbis track (started 2026-07-18) — branch `feature/vorbis-decoder`

Clean-room Ogg-Vorbis I **decoder** for the `.sf3` soundfont path (CometBeat
driver). **Clean-room affidavit:** implemented from the Vorbis I specification
(xiph.org) ONLY; no libvorbis / stb_vorbis / tremor / ffmpeg codec source was
read or copied. ffmpeg and sox(libvorbis) are used solely as black-box
reference decoders, and sox(libvorbis) as the corpus encoder (ffmpeg 8.1 on
this box has only the experimental native encoder, which fails to emit; sox
`-C q` drives libvorbis). Two independent references available: **ffmpeg**
(`ffmpeg -i x.ogg -f f32le`) and **sox** (`sox x.ogg -t f32 -`). MIT headers
on all new files.

Staging (spec §4–§9, §12), each slice green before the next:

- **Slice 1 — Ogg glue + id-header + detect split (DONE 2026-07-18).**
  `src/vorbis_bits.hpp` (LSB-first BitReader, spec §2 + `ilog`),
  `src/vorbis_ogg.hpp` (generic first-logical-stream packet demux, reuses
  `glint::opus::ogg_crc`), `src/vorbis_decoder.{hpp,cpp}` (identification
  header parse §4.2.2 — channels/rate/power-of-two blocksizes/framing;
  validates the 3 header packets), `src/vorbis_c_api.cpp`
  (`glint_vorbis_decode` / `_ex`, C ABI in glint.h). `detect()` in
  `decode_audio_c_api.cpp` no longer maps ANY `OggS`→Opus: it peeks the first
  packet — `OpusHead`→Opus, `\x01vorbis`→Vorbis — and routes accordingly.
  Verified on a real libvorbis stream (`sox` q3, 44.1k mono): demux → 26
  packets, granule 22050, id valid ch=1 bs 256/2048. Unit tests: LSB bit
  reader + id-header parse/reject (`test_vorbis_*` in test_unit.cpp).
  Full existing ctest suite still green (8/8), zero Opus/MP3/AAC regression.
- **Slice 2 — codebooks (Huffman + VQ lookup 1/2) (DONE 2026-07-18).**
  `read_codebook` (spec §3.2.1): sync 0x564342, dims/entries, ordered+sparse
  length coding, lookup types 0/1/2 with `float32_unpack` (§9.2.2) +
  `lookup1_values` (§9.2.3). Huffman decode via a leftmost-assigned binary
  tree (child0/child1 arrays, leaf = -(entry+2)); single-used-entry
  degenerate books read 0 bits; over-subscribed trees rejected; bounded
  allocation guard on multiplicands. `build_vq` materializes lookup-1/2
  value lists (sequence_p accumulation). Unit tests: the spec §3.2.1
  worked-example tree decodes e0/e5/e6/e1/e7 correctly, float32_unpack +
  lookup1_values spec values, over-subscription rejected. **Validated end
  to end on the real libvorbis stream: all 35 setup-header codebooks
  (scalar + VQ lookup-1) build with r=0.**
- **Slice 3 — setup header: floors / residues / mappings / modes (DONE
  2026-07-18).** `parse_setup` (spec §4.2.4): codebooks, time placeholders,
  floor type 1 (partitions/classes/subclass books/multiplier/rangebits/X
  list + derived low/high neighbours §9.2.5 + sorted order) and type 0
  config (LSP: order/rate/bark_map/amplitude/books), residue types 0/1/2
  (begin/end/partition_size/classifications/classbook/cascade/books),
  mapping type 0 (submaps, coupling steps with ilog(ch-1) magnitude/angle,
  mux, per-submap floor+residue), modes (blockflag/window/transform/mapping),
  framing bit. Reserved-field + bounds validation throughout. Test hook
  `debug_parse_headers`. **Validated across a real libvorbis corpus (sox
  -C 0/3/6/10, mono+stereo, 22.05k+44.1k): every stream parses with 0 and
  consumes all setup bits bar the final-byte padding (0–6 bits).** ctest:
  `test_vorbis_setup` embeds a real stream (`tests/vorbis_test_stream.h`)
  and gates the parse. Full existing suite green.
- **Slice 4 — audio decode (DONE 2026-07-18, first end-to-end).** Floor 1
  decode + curve synthesis (§7.2, render_point/render_line, floor1_inverse_dB
  geometric table from the spec's two literal anchors), residue types 0/1/2
  with the classification/partition loop (§8.6) and per-type partition layout,
  inverse channel coupling (§4.3.5, last→first), floor·residue dot product,
  inverse MDCT and windowed overlap-add (§4.3.1/§4.3.8). **Key findings while
  bringing it up:** (a) the IMDCT cosine argument must be (π/M)(p+½+M/2)(k+½)
  — an earlier ×2 argument gave the classic frequency-doubling aliasing;
  (b) libvorbis's backward-MDCT normalization is a **unit constant** (the
  forward carries the 1/M), verified by a self-consistent MDCT roundtrip
  (283 dB) and the corpus; (c) the overlap-add carry offset is (i−left_start),
  not a global-position scheme. **Measured vs ffmpeg (float64 SNR, aligned):
  chirp 118.3 / noise 118.3 / mono-tone 118.9 / stereo 119.8 dB raw, 137–139
  dB after removing a uniform 1.2 ppm scale (float32-precision floor).
  glint matches the SECOND reference sox(libvorbis) exactly as well as ffmpeg
  does (identical 77/90 dB vs sox's lower-precision f32 output) — i.e. glint
  agrees with BOTH references to float precision.** Self-contained ctest
  `test_vorbis_decode` decodes the embedded stream and asserts on-pitch
  (recovered period 100 samples = 440 Hz). Full existing suite green (8/8).
  Floor 0 (LSP) config is parsed but its synthesis is not yet implemented
  (the sox/ffmpeg corpus is all floor 1; a floor-0 stream returns an error
  rather than wrong audio).
- **Slice 5 — decode-vs-reference dB ctest gate (DONE 2026-07-18).**
  `tools/vorbis_dec_cli` + `tools/test_vorbis_decoder.py`, ctest
  `vorbis_decoder_vs_ffmpeg`: sox(libvorbis) corpus decoded by glint, ffmpeg
  and sox; gates glint-vs-ffmpeg raw ≥100 dB / shape ≥120 dB and glint-vs-sox
  parity with ffmpeg. 16 short configs green (raw 117.7–119.8, shape 135–138).
- **Slice 4b — fast (N/4-FFT) inverse MDCT (DONE 2026-07-18).** The
  correctness-first O(N²) iMDCT with a live `cos()` in its inner loop was a
  real **DoS hang** on long/large-block clips (a low-piano FluidR3Mono.sf3
  sample: ~500 long packets × M² transcendental calls → minutes). Replaced by
  `src/vorbis_imdct.hpp` `FastImdct`: an H=N/4 radix-2 complex FFT with
  pre/post twiddle + TDAC unfold, generalized from glint's proven AAC
  `ImdctPlan` to any power-of-two N and normalized to the Vorbis convention
  (×M vs ImdctPlan — the two conventions are identical MDCTs:
  (2π/N)(n+n0)(k+½)=(π/M)(n+½+M/2)(k+½)). Unit test `test_vorbis_imdct` diffs
  fast vs the direct O(N²) reference across N=64..8192 (matches to ~1e-12).
  **Results:** the real "Piano FF B0(R)" stream (97,798 B, 11.78 s) now
  decodes in **0.027 s** (was hanging), 519,598 frames = ffmpeg exactly,
  raw 117.9 / shape 136.7 dB, pitch 30.97 Hz (B0=30.87, on-pitch). Gate
  extended with 10 s long clips + a 20 s per-decode wall-clock guard so this
  hang class fails the gate; 19/19 configs green.
- **Slice 6 — Vorbis fuzz target (DONE 2026-07-18).** `tools/fuzz_vorbis.cpp`
  + `decoder_fuzz`: random / bit-flipped / truncated Ogg-Vorbis, plus
  **CRC-repaired mutations** that drive the setup-header parser (the classic
  attack surface). ASan+UBSan, wall-clock guard. **The fuzzer immediately
  caught a real heap-overflow:** the setup header's cross-references (residue
  `classbook`/books, floor masterbooks/subclass books, mapping floor/residue
  indices) were used as vector indices with no bounds check. Fixed with a
  validation pass in `parse_setup` that rejects any out-of-range reference,
  plus a tighter codebook-entry cap (2^20) for bounded allocation. 150k
  decode calls clean under ASan+UBSan; real streams unaffected; full ctest
  green (9/9).
- **Slice 7 — bindings parity + floor 0 + docs (DONE 2026-07-19).**
  - **Dart:** `GlintVorbisDecoder` (whole-buffer -> Float32List + sr/ch via
    `glint_vorbis_decode`) + `example/vorbis_decode.dart` (dedicated vs
    whole-file agree). **wasm:** exported `_glint_vorbis_decode`, added
    `FORMAT.VORBIS` + `decodeVorbis` to `glint_codec.mjs`, rebuilt `glint.wasm`
    via emsdk (ENVIRONMENT now `web,worker,node`); node smoke decodes a .ogg
    (17640 frames, MP3/AAC/Opus unregressed) — first commit of the wasm
    binding into the repo. **Rust:** `glint_sys::glint_vorbis_decode` +
    `glint::decode_vorbis`; build.rs compiles the vorbis sources; cargo test
    green. **Python:** `decode_bytes` decodes Vorbis via auto-detect —
    explicit `VorbisDecodeTest` (embedded stream) in the always-on
    python_bindings gate.
  - **Floor 0 (LSP):** implemented (spec §6.2.2/§6.2.3) and wired in. Caveat:
    **no encoder emits floor 0** (libvorbis has used floor 1 exclusively since
    before 1.0; every sox quality here is floor 1), so there is no real
    floor-0 stream to gate E2E — the math is cross-checked against an
    independent reference (`test_vorbis_floor0`, golden values).
  - **README** documents the decoder (highlights, dB numbers, C ABI, all four
    wrappers, roadmap). **pub.dev:** `glint_audio` 0.9.0 -> 0.10.0 + CHANGELOG
    (commit only; publish needs a `glint_audio-v0.10.0` tag — NOT created).
  - Clean-room affidavit + MIT headers intact. Full ctest green (9/9); merged
    to `main`.
- Slices 3+: setup header (floors/residues/mappings/modes) → floor 1 →
  residue 0/1/2 + inverse coupling → iMDCT + overlap-add → dB gate vs
  ffmpeg+sox (≥120 dB) → floor 0 (LSP) → bindings → fuzz → `.sf3` E2E.

**Downstream note (2026-07-26):** CometBeat now vendors and ships the encode
ABI on ALL SIX targets — the five native platforms via its `native/glint` FFI
plugin (`sync_glint.sh` copies the closure verbatim) and the web target via
`bindings/wasm`. So `glint_encode_audio` / `glint_decode_audio` have a real
consumer on every platform, and a breaking ABI change there is now a downstream
break, not a private refactor. Two things that surfaced from that integration
and are worth knowing here: MSVC needs `_USE_MATH_DEFINES` for the five sources
that use `M_PI` (fixed in the consumer's CMake, since the vendored copies must
stay verbatim — glint may want it in its own build files too), and
`decode_audio_c_api.cpp` defines `glint_flac_decode`, which collides with any
downstream that wrote its own thin FLAC wrapper.

**Vorbis ENCODER — scoped, UNCLAIMED, and deliberately not started.**
Handover: `docs/VORBIS_ENCODER_HANDOVER.md`. Short version: for audio EXPORT it
is redundant (Opus beats Vorbis at every bitrate), so the only real trigger is
**writing `.sf3` SoundFonts** — that format is Vorbis or nothing, and CometBeat
can currently only read it. Clean-room is genuinely viable because **Vorbis
transmits its codebooks in the setup header**: libvorbis's tuned books are its
private choice, not part of the format, so an encoder ships its own and never
needs to see theirs. The decoder above is the oracle (same pattern as
`test_opus_encoder.py`, where libopus verifies every stream we emit). New work
is concentrated in ONE place — codebook generation; floor 1, residue and the
headers are all mirrors of files we already own. Do NOT implement floor 0 (no
real encoder emits it) and do NOT add Vorbis to the export UI.

# AAC-LC track (started 2026-07-06)

One repo, two codecs: the AAC encoder lives in `src/aac_*.{hpp,cpp}` with
its own C API (`glint_aac_*`), sharing the repo's build, CLI and test
harness. The MP3 lessons carry over wholesale: decode-based gates from
day one (the m2 lesson), tables cross-checked from independent sources,
exact bit accounting, quality changes gated on metrics.

## A0. Phase 1 — wire-correct long-block CBR encoder — DONE (merged)

- **Tables** (`src/aac_tables.hpp`, generated by `tools/gen_aac_tables.py`):
  normative ISO 13818-7/14496-3 data — 11 spectral Huffman books, the
  scalefactor book, sfb offsets for all 12 rates (long + short) — extracted
  from BOTH vo-aacenc (Apache-2.0) and ffmpeg aactab.c, cross-checked
  bit-for-bit, each book verified prefix-free (Kraft), before emission.
- **MDCT** (`aac_mdct.cpp`): 2048-point per the ISO formula
  (X[k] = 2·Σ z[n]cos(2π/N(n+n0)(k+½))), computed as ±fold →
  DCT-IV via 512-pt FFT with e^{-iπ(n+1/8)/M} pre/post twiddles.
  Unit-tested against the direct O(N²) formula (<1e-10 rel). The
  fold/twiddle convention was locked with a numpy prototype first.
- **Coder** (`aac_coder.cpp`): pow-3/4 quantizer with the 0.4054 magic
  offset, flat scalefactors (= global_gain), OPTIMAL sectioning via DP
  over (band, book) with 9-bit section-header transitions, exact bit
  count by running the emitter in count-only mode (section-length
  escapes included). Book-11 escapes, sign bits, 4/2-tuple indexing all
  wire-validated. Binary-search gain fit like MP3's, with last-accepted
  state reuse.
- **Framing** (`aac_encoder.cpp`): ADTS (MPEG-4 ID, LC profile),
  SCE/CPE + common_window ics_info, bit-debt CBR controller (target
  minus spent, clamped to the 6144-bit/ch decoder buffer) — AAC frames
  are variable-length, so there is NO MP3-style backstep hazard; the
  average converges exactly (128.0/256.1/64.0/48.0 kbps measured).
  Encoder delay: exactly 1024 samples (verified by the decode test's
  cross-correlation alignment); `glint_aac_flush` emits the tail frame.
- **Validation**: ffmpeg AND CoreAudio (afconvert) decode all configs
  with zero errors and METRICALLY IDENTICAL output (25.83/28.00/10.16
  both decoders on speech-128) — the wire format is unambiguous.
  ctest gate `aac_decode_quality` (tests/test_aac.py): 5 configs
  (44.1/48/22.05 kHz, mono/stereo, 48-256 kbps), zero-decoder-error +
  SNR floors ~10 dB below introduction-day measurements (40/48/41/37/40 dB).
- **Speech-clip numbers** (1-min ref, flat quantization, NO psy model):
  128k stereo SNR 25.8 / segSNR 28.0 / NMR +0.5 (26% audible) — psy
  headroom is the whole phase-2 story; 256k stereo SNR 37.2 / segSNR
  38.7 / NMR −10.4 / 1.0% audible — ALREADY ahead of glint-MP3-256k
  SNR (36.1–36.7) on pure coding efficiency. ~120× realtime unoptimized.

## A1. Phase 2 — quality (roadmap)

Ordered by expected payoff, all gated on the standard clip set + league
table (add AAC rows to tests/compare_encoders.py; fdk-aac and Apple
afconvert are the yardsticks, vo-aacenc is the Shine-role baseline):
1. **Psy model + NMR outer loop — DONE (2026-07-06).** Per-band
   scalefactors (bidirectional offsets ±30 around the gain anchor, dpcm
   chain emission), metric-aligned Schroeder-Bark masks (aac_psy.cpp),
   outer loop at -q normal/best. Speech 128k stereo NMR +0.46 → −0.58
   (audible 26.1→23.6%, SNR 25.8→24.2), speech 256k −10.35 → −11.54
   (p95 −3.8→−5.7); electronic 128k 2.30→1.93; quartet 128k −0.55→−1.31,
   quartet 256k −9.52→−12.10 with audible 2.0→0.0%. ~30× realtime.
   **AAC-specific learnings (differ from the MP3 loop!):**
   - MP3's 1.25× total-noise guard FREEZES the AAC loop at 128k: AAC CBR
     has no reservoir slack, and one gain-anchor step is already ×1.41
     total noise. The working structure: bidirectional offsets (coarsen
     over-coded bands ≥6 dB below target to donate bits — MP3 could only
     amplify), a per-band ceiling at the MASK (r ≤ max(1, r0)·1.05 — a
     ceiling at the target instead froze everything), two amplification
     tiers (r>1 audible bands every round + near-worst masked bands),
     de-amp hysteresis (never coarsen a rescued band), and a loose 2.5×
     total-noise backstop chosen by measurement (8.0 buys +0.2 NMR for
     −0.8 SNR — not taken).
   - ATH floor must be calibrated against a RUNNING max band energy, not
     per-frame (per-frame gives quiet frames absurd floors; the loop
     burns budget on phantom violations — the metric calibrates
     file-globally for the same reason).
   - normal and best currently converge to the same fixed point (caps 16
     vs 40 iterations are both past convergence); differentiate later
     via tonality masks / finer steps, not more iterations.
   - Comparison points measured on the speech clip at 128k stereo:
     glint −0.58 / ffmpeg-native AAC −0.68 / LAME MP3 −2.65 / **Apple
     AAC −6.52, audible 5%** — the remaining gap to Apple is mostly
     M/S + TNS + short blocks, not loop tuning.
2. **Per-band M/S — DONE (2026-07-06).** ms_mask_present per-sfb flags
   (0/1/2 encoded), decision per band by the mask-relative product rule
   (t+eM)(t+eS) < (t+eL)(t+eR) with t = min(maskL, maskR); chosen bands
   transformed in place before fit/shaping, and BOTH M and S shape
   against t (the AAC form of "never shape the side channel unmasked" —
   noise in either lands in decoded L and R). Active at all qualities.
   The single biggest quality step so far — every metric improved on
   every clip at every rate: speech 128k best NMR −0.58→−3.05 (audible
   12.4%) with SNR UP 24.2→26.1; speech 256k −11.5→−16.0, SNR
   35.2→41.9; electronic 128k 1.93→−0.95; quartet 128k −1.31→−5.52,
   256k −15.0 / 0.0% audible, SNR 50.6. The AAC path now beats glint's
   MP3 path outright (speech 256k: 41.9/−16.0 vs MP3 joint 38.0/−13.8).
   Remaining Apple gap at 128k: −3.05 vs −6.52.
3. **Window switching + short blocks — DONE (2026-07-06).** All four
   window sequences; 8×256 MDCTs over the centre region [448,1600);
   attack-split grouping (≤3 groups: [0,s) [s,s+2) [s+2,8), s from the
   attack sub-block ±4 window offset); band-layout abstraction
   (AacBandLayout) makes short frames look like long ones to the
   quantizer/sectioner (coded-order interleave group→sfb→window, the
   MP3 reorder trick; sections never cross groups; sect_len esc 7/3-bit
   vs 31/5-bit). Transient detector: 8 sub-block first-difference
   energies vs rolling baseline (8×, fast-rise slow-fall), one-block
   lookahead hold → encoder delay 2048; flush emits two tail frames.
   Short frames are NOT psy-shaped and use the energy-only M/S rule
   (t=0 in the product rule); START/STOP not shaped (MP3 lesson).
   GLINT_AAC_FORCE_SHORT=1 forces all-short for diagnostics.
   **Castanets 128k best: NMR +17.7 → −3.46, audible 13.4→3.1%;
   256k +9.2 → −9.77.** Contenders on the same clip at 128k: LAME
   +1.15, ffmpeg-native AAC +7.14, Apple −6.70/1.9%. Steady clips
   improve-or-hold exactly (quartet byte-similar — scheduler never
   fires; electronic gains 2.7 dB NMR from real transients; speech
   +0.5 dB NMR, +0.4 SNR). Wire-validated: ffmpeg + CoreAudio decode
   all transition sequences with zero errors; burst-train config added
   to tests/test_aac.py.
4. **TNS — DONE (2026-07-06), selective activation.** Long-family
   windows, one filter over [~2.5 kHz band, min(max_sfb,
   tns_max_bands)), order ≤ 8, 4-bit arcsin-quantized reflection
   coefficients, forward direction, active only when LPC prediction
   gain ≥ 4.0. Measured (best): castanets 128k NMR −3.46 → **−8.38**
   (audible 3.1→1.0% — now ahead of Apple's −7.41, near FDK's −9.02);
   electronic 128k −3.64 → −4.30, 256k −14.61 → −15.39; speech and
   quartet hold (quartet: filter never fires on strings — the
   selectivity working as intended). GLINT_AAC_NO_TNS=1 disables
   (diagnostic).
   **Hard-won wire/DSP invariants (a full debugging afternoon):**
   - The transmitted values are REFLECTION coefficients; the ISO
     dequant map is +sin(idx/iqfac) (== vo-aacenc's tnsCoeff4, which
     the table generator cross-checks). ffmpeg stores its
     tns_tmp2_map PRE-NEGATED and negates again inside
     compute_lpc_coefs — the double negation cancels. Transmit k
     as-is; do NOT negate to "match" ffmpeg's r = -coef line.
   - tns length counts down from num_swb (the samplerate's FULL sfb
     count), NOT from max_sfb: length = num_swb - start_band. The
     decoder clips the line range to min(max_sfb, tns_max_bands).
   - Decoder tool order is M/S recombine THEN per-channel TNS
     synthesis → encoder must TNS-filter L/R BEFORE the M/S
     transform. Stereo speech cannot catch this bug (L≈R makes the
     filters identical, and identical filters commute with M/S) —
     MONO is the oracle for TNS correctness.
   - Naive activation (gain ≥ 1.4, order 12, from 1 kHz) REGRESSED
     every metric (ODG −0.87 → −1.09): with per-band scalefactor
     shaping already active, TNS's spectral whitening fights the
     allocator and only strongly-predictable frames profit. Judge
     TNS on ODG/PESQ + castanets NMR, not speech Bark-NMR.
   - Wire-correctness probe that settles "is the filter inverted
     right": encode at 640k with/without TNS — a real mismatch
     collapses SNR to ~15 dB; correct TNS costs ~1.5 dB at the 65 dB
     level. In-process round-trip vs the decoder recursion
     (scratch test) proved the math exact before the wire hunt.
5. **Tonality-aware masks — DONE (2026-07-06).** Per-masker offsets
   −(6 + 12·α) dB from band spectral flatness (α∈[0,1]) instead of the
   metric's flat −14 dB, ported from the MP3 nmr_outer_loop tonal
   path, gated at ≤96 kbps/ch like MP3. Judged on ODG/PESQ (the
   in-house NMR is expected to diverge slightly since the offsets no
   longer match the metric's): speech 128k ODG −0.87→−0.85 / PESQ
   4.51→4.54; 64k mono ODG −2.34→−2.23; **electronic 128k ODG
   −0.78→−0.49**; quartet −0.35→−0.32; castanets ≈0.01 (transparent
   boundary). NMR holds within 0.15 everywhere. 256k paths unchanged
   (gate off above 96 kbps/ch).
6. **Bandwidth heuristic → psy-driven max_sfb** (current cutoffs are a
   placeholder table roughly tracking fdk defaults).

## A1b. AAC league table — measured 2026-07-06 (post short blocks)

`python tests/compare_encoders.py --codec aac` (new `--codec` flag; ADTS
everywhere; lame-q2 rides along as MP3 anchor). Contenders: Apple
afconvert `-f adts -d aac -s 0` (CBR), fdkaac (`brew install
fdk-aac-encoder`, `-f 2` for ADTS), ffmpeg native aac, vo-aacenc
(`~/code/glint-tools/vo-aacenc/aac-enc`, built from mstorsjo/vo-aacenc:
autoreconf+configure for the lib, then
`cc -O2 -I. -Icommon/include -o aac-enc aac-enc.c wavreader.c
common/cmnMemory.c .libs/libvo-aacenc.a`; NB `-r` is BITRATE in bps).
Full table in the 2026-07-06 run log; NMR summary at 128k:

- glint-normal places 1st on quartet (−5.5 vs Apple −2.9 / fdk −2.6)
  and industrial (−1.6 vs Apple −1.1 / fdk −0.8); 2nd on piano (−8.7,
  between Apple −9.4 and fdk −8.5); 3rd on speech (−3.6 vs −6.9/−5.4),
  electronic (−3.6 vs −9.9/−11.4) and castanets (−3.5 vs −7.4/−9.0,
  but ODG −0.04 ≈ Apple/fdk's −0.08 — PEAQ says the transients are
  fine; the NMR gap is steady-state). ALWAYS ahead of ffmpeg-native,
  LAME-MP3 and vo-aacenc (vo: castanets NMR +18.6, ODG −3.x on tonal
  clips — the quality floor of the league).
- 256k: ODG ≈ 0 for Apple/fdk/glint/LAME on every clip. glint SNR
  highest of the AAC field on 4/6 clips; quartet NMR −15.0 = 1st.
  Remaining NMR gap to Apple/fdk at 128k on speech/electronic =
  the TNS + better-psy (tonality) work, not rate control.
- glint-speed sometimes beats normal on castanets NMR (−5.1 vs −3.5):
  shaping the long frames around transitions costs a little there —
  revisit when shorts get shaped (A1.4).
- Speed (this run, moderate load): glint 39-86x depending on tier/clip;
  Apple ~100x, fdk 53-110x, vo ~94-168x, ffmpeg-native 6-56x. Idle
  spot-check: glint-aac speed/normal/best = 85/41/37x. No AAC perf
  pass yet.
- RAM (method: sizeof(glint_aac_context) via a measurement TU that
  #includes aac_encoder.cpp; statics via `size -m` per object with
  -fno-lto): glint-aac double = 61.4 KB context + 55.5 KB BSS
  (33.4 mdct tables + 22.1 psy model) ≈ 117 KB. vo-aacenc = 48 KB
  heap total (measured by logging its cmnMemAlloc; zero BSS) — its
  "several hundred KB" reputation is Arduino-wrapper overhead, so the
  phase-3 target is UNDER 48 KB, which is genuinely tight (the 2x1024
  double MDCT lookback alone is 16 KB → int16/int32 input buffers and
  a Q31 path are mandatory, plus single-slot psy/mdct models).

## A2. Phase 3 — RAM diet — DONE (2026-07-06); Q31 arithmetic still open

Under GLINT_SMALL_BUFFERS (defined by GLINT_MODE=fixed builds):
**47.6 KB measured** (25.0 KB context + 22.6 KB BSS) vs vo-aacenc's
48.0 KB — and quality is METRICS-IDENTICAL to the desktop double build
(every SNR/NMR/aud figure matches to the printed precision on speech
128k/256k; full unit + decode suites green). Desktop double also
dropped 117 → 106.5 KB from the shared half-window tables.

What the diet is: STORAGE-only type changes — arithmetic stays double
throughout (SpecT/PcmT in aac_coder_types_fwd.hpp):
- spectra + masks stored as float, PCM lookback blocks as int16 (the
  float encode path clamps to int16 under the flag),
- MDCT twiddles/windows + psy spread/ath tables as float,
- sine windows stored half-length (symmetric, mirrored accessor),
- FFT bit-reversal computed inline (no rev table),
- output buffer 4 KB (two tail frames fit).

## A5. Distortion-controlled allocator — DONE (2026-07-06); PE rate control REJECTED

The 128k push. Per-Bark diagnosis vs Apple showed we were ~5-7 dB worse
ACROSS the whole spectrum at equal bits — the iterative amplify/walk
never reaches a noise~mask allocation (it stalls near its own target
from a flat start). Two experiments:
- **PE bit-demand rate control: REJECTED.** Scaling per-frame budgets
  by a perceptual-entropy proxy (EMA-normalized, [0.75,1.5]x) measured
  WORSE at strong settings and a no-op at gentle ones — bit quantity
  was not the binding constraint. Reverted; don't retry without a
  different difficulty signal.
- **aac_fit_channel_masked: SHIPPED** (normal/best CBR long frames).
  Per-band scalefactors in closed form from noise targets
  mask^alpha * k (uniform-noise model: sf = 100 + 2*alpha*log2(12m/w)),
  the loudness knob k bisected as an INTEGER sf offset (2 sf steps per
  factor 2 — deterministic), a min-SNR floor on CODED bands only
  (kSnrMinDb 10; applying it to masked bands force-coded inaudible
  junk and collapsed ODG to -3.3 — the sf_zero guard is essential),
  and one measure-and-correct pass. alpha swept by ODG/PESQ: 1.0
  (pure mask-following) LOSES on speech (PESQ 4.54->4.24 — the model
  trusts our crude masks too much); **alpha = 0.6 shipped**.
  Gating that made it safe: allocator only when frames_since_short >=
  26 (direct allocation on post/pre-transient long frames cost
  castanets ODG -0.01 -> -0.23; with the gate castanets is EXACTLY
  baseline) and >= 56 kbps/ch (the walk measured better at 64k mono).
  Everything else keeps the A1.1 walk.
  Results (best, vs the walk): speech 128k ODG -0.85 -> -0.82, p95
  2.42 -> 2.27, audible 12.6 -> 11.9%; electronic 128k ODG -0.49 ->
  -0.37, audible 9.2 -> 8.7; quartet audible 8.5 -> 6.9 (ODG -0.35 ->
  -0.39, within PEAQ noise); speech 256k NMR -16.62 -> -17.16, p95
  -10.33 -> -11.05, 0.0% audible; castanets/64k hold. Decode-gate SNR
  floors re-based (the allocator legitimately trades raw SNR on tonal
  synthetics for masked placement — floors are decode sanity, not
  quality gates).

## A6. Shaped short frames — DONE (2026-07-06)

Short frames were the last flat-quantized path. Added
aac_compute_masks_short (per-group Schroeder spreading over the short
sfbs, flat −14 dB offset — no tonality at 128-line resolution; energies
normalized per window inside the model, returned in the band domain;
SEPARATE emax_run_short domain) and ran the direct allocator on short
frames with its own tilt kAlphaS.
Measured decisions:
- kAlphaS = 0.2 (kAlphaL stays 0.6): 0.35+ dumped noise onto the tonal
  background INSIDE short frames — castanets ODG fine but the synthetic
  burst-train SNR collapsed 26→15 dB and electronic ODG dipped; 0.2
  keeps nearly all the NMR win with burst SNR 23.6.
- The masked M/S rule on shorts was suspected for an electronic ODG dip
  and DISENTANGLED: it was innocent (energy rule kept anyway — masks
  still flow to the allocator). The dip traced to the long-frame
  transient gate, and a graduated alpha derate (scale by fss/26) LOST
  everywhere — a derated allocator does nothing while the walk works,
  so the hard >= 26-frame gate stays with the walk as fallback.
Final (128k best vs pre-shorts): castanets NMR −8.40→−8.45, audible
0.9→0.8, ODG 0.00 (transparent); electronic −4.28→−4.34, aud 8.7→8.6;
speech −3.55→−3.64, p95 2.42→2.11, aud 12.6→11.8; quartet −5.84,
aud 6.9, ODG −0.38; speech-256 −17.03. All suites green.

## A2c. Embedded validation harness — DONE (2026-07-06)

embedded/: shared FPU-free bench core; QEMU mps2-an385 semihosted run
(both codecs encode under soft-float Cortex-M3, streams written back to
the host via semihosting, decode CLEAN in ffmpeg+CoreAudio, MP3 stream
BIT-EXACT vs a host run — integer determinism across architectures);
pico-sdk and ESP-IDF benchmark projects for real-silicon throughput.
tools/check_nofpu.sh = static proof: M0+ disassembly of every
per-coefficient function contains zero __aeabi_* soft-float calls
(lazy table builders moved to startup global ctors to make this
provable; byte-stable). QEMU is NOT cycle-accurate — throughput still
needs hardware. Toolchain: xPack arm-none-eabi (Homebrew's formula has
no libc); GLINT_NO_THREADS skips the std::thread pool on bare metal.

## A3. Perf pass 1 — DONE (2026-07-06): −52..54% encode time, byte-identical

Profile-driven (macOS `sample`, -q best): eval_gain was 66% of runtime
(quantize + per-band cost for up to 11 books via separate code_band
walks + DP) and the count-only aac_write_ics_body re-walk another 13%.
Three changes, all verified BYTE-IDENTICAL across
{speed,normal,best} x {128,256,64-mono} in BOTH build modes (double and
fixed/INT), plus castanets-best and 22.05k:
- band_costs(): all valid books' spectral bits in TWO passes over the
  band (one 4-tuple pass for books 1-4, one pair pass for 5-11 incl.
  book-11 escapes) instead of up to eleven code_band walks. Identical
  bit arithmetic; code_band stays for emission.
- Zero bands cost O(1): ntuples * zero-tuple bits (lazy table from
  kSpecBits — the old code walked the whole band for every book).
- Exact ICS count is now O(num_bands) ARITHMETIC: spectral bits summed
  from the cost table, sections/scf-dpcm/tns counted in closed form —
  no more count-only emission over the spectrum. A GLINT_AAC_COUNT_CHECK
  define cross-checks it against the emitter (used to validate; the
  count==emission unit test also gates it).
- getenv() calls cached out of per-frame/per-iteration paths.
Measured (300 s speech, interleaved min-of-5): speed −54%, normal −52%,
best −52%. Absolute: double 272x/168x realtime (speed/best), fixed/INT
241x/140x — glint-aac -q speed is now the fastest encoder in the league
(Apple ~104x). Byte-identity gate caveat for the future: zsh does NOT
word-split unquoted $args — a broken gate loop compared stale files and
reported false DIFFERs; use eval or arrays.

## A4. AAC VBR — DONE (2026-07-06)

Constant-quality VBR the way ADTS wants it: no debt controller, every
frame may spend to the 6144-bit/ch cap, and a per-quality ANCHOR-GAIN
FLOOR (aac_fit_channel gain_floor param) is what limits spend — the
direct analog of MP3's vbr_target_gain, minus all the Xing/placeholder
machinery (ADTS frames are self-describing; nothing to rewrite).
Config: glint_aac_config.vbr / vbr_quality (consumed two reserved
slots — same struct size, zero = CBR; the smoke test promptly proved
WHY the zero-init contract exists: a stack-constructed config had
garbage in .vbr). Shaping under VBR runs at spent+25% like MP3's VBR
shaping. Ladder kVbrGain[10] = 133..162 (~1.5 dB noise/step),
calibrated on the speech clip: V0 311 kbps / NMR −16.8 / 0.0% audible
(beats CBR-256's −16.6), V2 220k, V4 153k / −4.1, V6 100k, V9 42k;
electronic V4 lands at 134k (content-adaptive, as VBR should).
GLINT_AAC_VBR_GAIN overrides the floor for experiments. CLI -V works
for .aac outputs now; python binding takes vbr_quality=, rust/dart
struct mirrors updated. CBR paths byte-identical; all decode gates
green (a V4 config joined tests/test_aac.py).

## A2b. No-FPU integer hot path — DONE (2026-07-06), GLINT_AAC_INT

GLINT_MODE=fixed now also defines GLINT_AAC_INT: spectra are int32 (Q3,
spec_int = spec_true*8) and ALL per-coefficient work is integer —
targets RP2040/Cortex-M0+ class parts where soft-float at
per-coefficient rates is fatal:
- Integer MDCT: Q30 twiddles/windows, int64 butterflies with a rounded
  >>1 per FFT stage; measured transform SNR 131 dB vs the direct ISO
  formula. Scale note: natural output is Q(qin - log2 H) — the ISO 2x
  is part of the fold/DCT-IV algebra, NOT an extra bit (a wrong +1
  here read as a clean 6 dB "SNR" — scale bug, not noise).
- Integer quantizer: p34 cache holds log2(|x|^0.75) in Q16; the sf
  step is EXACT in Q16 (0.1875*65536 = 12288); ix = one add + one
  128-segment exp2 LUT. Parity vs the double formula: 0.04
  mismatched coefficients per frame.
- Integer band energies everywhere (psy accumulation, M/S decision,
  TNS autocorr, TNS mask compensation) — NO pre-shifts needed:
  Parseval bounds the whole frame's Q3^2 energy at ~2^59 (early >>8
  "safety" shifts zeroed quiet coefficients for nothing). Per-BAND
  math (spreading matmul, Levinson, rate control) stays double: a few
  k soft-float ops per frame is fine on M0+.
- Masks are float storage ALWAYS (SpecT-typed mask arrays truncated
  Q3^2 energies to int32 garbage and froze the shaping loop — subtle,
  found via GLINT_AAC_DEBUG traces).
- Measured (INT vs float small-buffers): speech 128k speed -1.67 vs
  -2.54, best -2.85 vs -3.52; 256k -14.57/-15.68 vs -16.05/-16.62;
  castanets 128k best -8.56 (BETTER than float's -8.38). Root cause
  of the stereo tax is PROVEN by the L==R experiment (identical
  channels -> INT == float exactly): integer M/S halving loses half
  an LSB on odd sums and the decoder's l=m+s cannot recover it.
  Counter-intuitively Q4 spec scale measured WORSE than Q3 overall
  (unresolved); the real fix if ever needed is a per-frame block
  exponent. Mono is bit-comparable to float.
- All suites green (unit incl. MDCT-vs-ISO at INT tolerances, decode
  gates, ffmpeg+CoreAudio). 112x realtime on M1 at -q speed. RAM
  unchanged at 47.6 KB (int32 == float width).
- Remaining honest gap to "runs realtime on RP2040": needs an actual
  cross-compile + on-target measurement; per-coefficient float is
  gone, per-frame float remains (spreading, Levinson, rate control).

Stack use (~30 KB transient in MDCT/fit) is not in the 47.6 KB figure;
neither is vo-aacenc's stack in its 48 KB (heap-only, same basis).

# Opus track (started 2026-07-10) — branch `feature/opus` ONLY

**Git workflow override for this track: commit to `feature/opus`, do NOT
merge to main** until explicitly cleared. (MP3/AAC work keeps the usual
merge-to-main rule.)

Scope assessment (2026-07-10): Opus (RFC 6716) = SILK (LPC speech coder,
8/12/16k internal) + CELT (MDCT, 2.5–20 ms at 48k) + hybrid mode, glued by
a shared range coder. Unlike MP3/AAC there are no scalefactors-as-side-info:
CELT's bit allocation is IMPLICIT — decoder re-derives it from the same
computation the encoder runs, keyed on tell_frac() at 1/8-bit precision, so
encoder/decoder must agree bit-for-bit on entropy-coder state. The normative
spec is the reference code (prose loses ties); decoder conformance = official
test vectors + opus_compare quality threshold, not bit-exactness. No
legal/patent reason for clean-room (BSD reference, royalty-free) — it's the
project ethos only, and reference implementations remain fair game as test
ORACLES (same rule as gen_aac_tables.py). Calibration: ffmpeg's independent
native Opus encoder is CELT-only and still clearly behind libopus after
years — "correct" is achievable, "league-competitive" is a long campaign.

Phases:
- **O0 — range coder — DONE (see below).**
- **O1 — CELT decoder**: mixed-radix FFT (MDCT sizes 120/240/480/960 =
  2^a·3·5, NOT power-of-two — the MP3/AAC FFTs don't cover this), coarse
  energy (2-D prediction + Laplace), fine energy, the implicit allocator,
  PVQ decode + spreading/folding + anti-collapse, TF resolution, intensity +
  mid/side, postfilter. Interim oracle before full conformance: CELT-only
  streams from `opus_demo` (restricted-lowdelay application forces CELT).
- **O2 — SILK decoder + hybrid**: LPC synthesis, LTP, stereo
  prediction/unmixing, resamplers. Gate: official test vectors 01–12 pass
  the opus_compare threshold (both rates of each vector).
- **O3 — Ogg Opus container** (RFC 7845): mux/demux, pre-skip, granule
  accounting; Opus packets are not self-framing (no ADTS analog).
- **O4 — CELT-only encoder**: reuses the decoder's allocator verbatim;
  PVQ search, coarse/fine energy quant, TF/transient decisions, VBR.
  Needs ec_enc_shrink + ec_enc_patch_initial_bits (not yet implemented in
  opus_ec). Validate: decode with libopus/ffmpeg, league via
  compare_encoders vs libopus + ffmpeg-native at matched rates.
- **O5 (optional) — SILK/hybrid encoder** for low-rate speech.

## O0. Range coder — DONE (2026-07-10), byte-identical to libopus

`src/opus_ec.{hpp,cpp}`: RangeEncoder/RangeDecoder per RFC 6716 §4.1 —
encode/encode_bin/bit_logp/icdf/uint/raw bits + tell/tell_frac, all-integer
(safe for GLINT_MODE=fixed), in the glint library build.

Verification, two layers:
- Unit tests (test_unit.cpp): randomized op-script round-trips (5 seeds ×
  2000 ops), per-op encoder-vs-decoder tell() parity, exact-size
  ceil(tell/8) buffer round-trip, carry stress (max-symbol runs), enc_uint
  edges around the 2^8 range/raw split. 260/260 pass.
- **Wire-compat gate: `tools/crosscheck_opus_ec.py`** builds libopus 1.5.2
  as an oracle in ~/code/glint-tools/opus-1.5.2 (static lib; ec_* symbols
  are linkable even though not public API), compiles
  `tools/opus_ec_crosscheck.cpp` twice (reference adapter vs glint), and
  requires byte-identical stdout: encoded buffers (full + exact-size),
  tell/tell_frac traces, decoded values — 8 seeds × 2000 ops × 6 op kinds.
  **PASS on first run.** Re-run after any opus_ec change.

Hard-won invariants:
- Decoder `val` is COMPLEMENTED (distance from the top of the range):
  init reads 127 − (b0>>1), renormalization inserts ~sym. Both sides
  report tell()==1 immediately after init.
- Range bits fill the buffer from the FRONT, raw bits (enc_bits) from the
  BACK; the two streams may legally share the final byte — done() ORs the
  raw-bit remainder into it. Total stream always fits ceil(tell/8) bytes.
- 0xFF chunks cannot be emitted eagerly (a later carry could ripple
  through); carry_out() buffers a run count (ext_) + one pending byte
  (rem_) and materializes on the next non-0xFF chunk.
- tell_frac refines ilog(rng) by 3 bits via repeated Q15 squaring of the
  top 16 bits of rng. CELT's allocator consumes this — it must match the
  reference EXACTLY (it does; traced per op in the cross-check).
- Still missing from opus_ec (needed by O4, trivial adds): ec_enc_shrink,
  ec_enc_patch_initial_bits.

## O1 progress (2026-07-10): primitives + energy + allocator + IMDCT DONE

All verified against libopus 1.5.2 oracles (custom-modes static build in
~/code/glint-tools/opus-1.5.2-custom — internal symbols are linkable, and
opus_custom_mode_create exposes the mode struct):

- **CELT mode tables**: src/opus_celt_tables.hpp GENERATED by
  tools/gen_opus_celt_tables.py (window matches the analytic formula at
  5.2e-9; note eband5ms/band_allocation live in celt/modes.c, not
  static_modes_float.h; eMeans is 25 entries, last 4 padding).
- **Laplace coder** (opus_laplace): byte-identical, incl. flat-tail clamp.
- **CWRS/PVQ enumeration** (opus_cwrs): table-free O(k) row recurrences
  (RAM-diet friendly vs libopus's 5 KB static table); index-for-index
  identical, cross-checked interleaved with laplace in one ec stream
  (tools/crosscheck_opus_celt_prims.py).
- **Energy envelope decode** (opus_celt_energy): coarse (2-D prediction +
  budget fallbacks <15/<2/<1 bits) / fine / finalise.
  tools/crosscheck_opus_energy.py — tells exact, energies within
  float-vs-double tolerance.
- **Bit allocator** (opus_celt_rate: compute_allocation_dec, bits2pulses,
  pulses2bits, init_caps): byte-identical over 200 fuzzed scenarios
  (tools/crosscheck_opus_alloc.py) incl. hybrid start=17, both channel
  counts, all LM, dynalloc boosts, negative budgets.
- **Inverse MDCT** (opus_mdct: CeltImdct + mixed-radix 2/3/4/5 FFT, all
  four shifts 960/480/240/120): matches clt_mdct_backward to <=1.3e-5
  (float oracle) incl. the interleaved-transient stride layout; O(S^2)
  direct-formula self-check at 1e-11. Contract documented in the header —
  NOTE: output is NOT plain overlap-add; out[0..ov/2) is a windowed TDAC
  rotation (read-modify-write), rest overwritten; in-place safe.

**KEY TESTING INSIGHT — fuzz oracles for decode-only components**: the
range decoder accepts ANY byte stream, so feeding both decoders identical
random buffers and comparing symbol/tell traces is a complete equivalence
gate without needing an encoder. All decode-side cross-checks use this.

GOTCHAS learned:
- Reference drivers need -DUSE_ALLOCA (stack_alloc.h errors otherwise) on
  top of -DOPUS_BUILD -DCUSTOM_MODES.
- pulses2bits/bits2pulses are only defined for pseudo-pulse indices
  <= cache.bits[index] (the row header); beyond that even libopus reads
  adjacent-row garbage. The allocator guarantees in-domain values.
- The pulse-cache bit costs saturate at 255 (uint8) on wide bands — cost
  curves plateau, so bits->pulses->bits round-trips only hold on the
  strictly monotonic part of the curve.
- ec_laplace_encode may CLAMP the value it codes (flat-tail overflow);
  any encoder must use the returned value, not the input.

NEXT (O1 remainder, in order):
1. bands.c decode side: quant_all_bands / quant_band recursion (theta
   splitting, lowband folding, spreading rotation, anti-collapse), TF
   decode, intensity/dual-stereo application. Fuzz-oracle against
   quant_all_bands with random streams; alg_unquant/exp_rotation are
   linkable for finer-grained checks.
2. celt_decoder.c top level: flags (silence/postfilter/transient/intra),
   dynalloc decode, denormalise, IMDCT+deemphasis chain, postfilter,
   anti-collapse hookup, PLC stub. Oracle: opus_custom_decoder or
   celt_decode_with_ec on CELT-only packets.
3. TOC/packet parse (code 0-3 framing) + opus_decode top level for
   CELT-only streams; oracle: opus_demo with restricted-lowdelay.
4. Then SILK (O2).

## O1 progress 2 (2026-07-10): band decoding DONE — the largest CELT piece

**opus_celt_bands.{hpp,cpp}** — decode side of bands.c/vq.c: quant_all_bands
(folding-source norm buffers, lowband_offset/update tracking, hybrid special
folding at start+1, dual-stereo->intensity switch), quant_band_stereo (theta
join, N==2 orthogonal-side sign trick), quant_band (tf recombine/subdivide
Haar chains, Hadamard reorder for transients, resynth un-do, sqrt(N) folding
scale), quant_partition (recursive splits, delta bit-split from bit-exact
integer log2tan, rebalance, PVQ leaf with budget walk-down, LCG noise/fold
fills), compute_theta (all three PDFs: step/uniform/triangular + isqrt32),
compute_qn, exp_rotation spreading, collapse masks, stereo_merge,
anti_collapse. Encode branches and theta-RDO dropped (decoder-only).

Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_bands.py — fuzz oracle wired exactly like
celt_decode_with_ec (allocator -> quant_all_bands -> anti-collapse bit ->
anti_collapse) over 150 random frames covering all LM, mono/stereo, hybrid
start=17, transient+tf combinations, all spread modes, dual stereo,
disable_inv. Collapse masks / LCG seeds / tells byte-identical; spectra
match to 4e-6 (float-vs-double). PASS.

Learnings:
- The decode path's ec reads are 100% integer-driven (qn/theta PDFs, delta
  via bitexact_cos/log2tan, cache walk-downs) — signal values never touch
  the wire, so the fuzz oracle is complete for this layer too.
- tf_res values must stay in tf_select_table's domain per (LM, transient)
  when fuzzing — arbitrary values hit UB in both implementations.
- The reference decoder aliases lowband_scratch onto X_'s last-band region;
  a separate scratch buffer is output-identical (scratch is written before
  read within each quant_band call, and the last band never uses it).
- Verify print-precision actually exercises the tolerance: at %.4f the
  spectra compared EQUAL (deltas hid below the grid) — bumped to %.6f to
  prove real float-vs-double deltas flow through the comparison.

NEXT: celt_decoder.c top level (flags, dynalloc, tf_decode, postfilter,
denormalise + IMDCT + deemphasis, PLC stub, energy state rotation), then
TOC/packet framing, then decode real CELT-only packets vs opus_demo.

## O1 MILESTONE (2026-07-10): CELT-only Opus decoding WORKS end-to-end

glint now decodes REAL Opus streams (CELT-only / restricted-lowdelay,
fullband 48 kHz) identically to libopus:

- **opus_celt_decoder.{hpp,cpp}**: full frame decode — silence/postfilter/
  transient/intra flags, tf_decode, spread, dynalloc, trim, allocation,
  energy layers, quant_all_bands, anti-collapse, denormalise, IMDCT
  overlap chain, comb-filter postfilter (5-tap, cross-faded), de-emphasis,
  energy/state rotation. Mono decoders set disable_inv=1 (celt_decoder_init
  policy — easy to miss).
- **opus_decoder.{hpp,cpp}**: TOC + framing codes 0-3 (padding, VBR),
  pcm_soft_clip (the int16 API's ±1 overshoot parabola).
- Gates:
  - tools/crosscheck_opus_celt_dec.py — frame-level fuzz vs
    opus_custom_decode_float with state carryover; PASS. NOTE: garbage
    streams drive gains to ~2^32, so the float oracle's rounding noise
    scales with the sequence's PEAK sample (persists via overlap memory);
    tolerance must be peak-scaled or it false-fails.
  - **tools/test_opus_e2e.py — the real-stream gate**: opus_demo
    (restricted-lowdelay) encodes sweep+noise+bursts at 2.5/5/10/20 ms,
    mono+stereo, VBR+CBR; glint decodes every packet with the decoder
    final range EQUAL to the encoder's (Opus conformance identity, exact,
    2206/2206 packets) and PCM within 3 int16 LSB of opus_demo's decode.
- Debug war story: 4 configs showed up-to-646-LSB PCM diffs while ALL
  final ranges matched -> integer path proven right, suspicion on floats;
  frame-level A/B on the same stream showed ZERO diffs -> the difference
  was opus_demo's int16 API applying opus_pcm_soft_clip (codec overshoot
  beyond ±1 on low-rate bursty content). Ported pcm_soft_clip; all green.
  Lesson: "final range equal + PCM off" means look OUTSIDE the decoder.
- opus_demo lives at ~/code/glint-tools/opus_demo (built from the custom
  tree; needs -I silk for debug.h). .bit format: per packet 4B BE length +
  4B BE encoder final range + payload.

O1 remainder (small): CELT-only narrower bandwidths (end<21 — NB/WB/SWB
TOC configs 16..27), stream-channels != decoder-channels up/downmix paths,
PLC (celt_decode_lost). Then O2 (SILK), O3 (Ogg).

## O1 remainder (2026-07-10): endband + channel mixing DONE; PLC deferred

- decode_frame now takes (stream_channels, end_band): NB/WB/SWB/FB CELT
  configs map to end 13/17/19/21 (kEndband in opus_decoder.cpp), and
  mono<->stereo mismatches use the reference synthesis paths (mono->stereo:
  freq copy staged INSIDE ch1's output region, in-place IMDCT trick;
  stereo->mono: average denormalised spectra). Decode loops use stream C;
  memmove/postfilter/deemphasis use decoder CC.
- E2E gate now 18 configs (bandwidths + both mismatch directions +
  VBR/CBR + all frame sizes): ALL final ranges exact, PCM <= 4 LSB.
- Still open in O1: PLC (celt_decode_lost) — deferred to the O2 arc since
  opus_decode_native's PLC clock matters for SILK too.

## O2 SILK decoder — architecture survey (2026-07-10) + plan

SILK is FIXED-POINT throughout (int16/int32 exact) => every fuzz oracle
gives BYTE-IDENTICAL comparisons, no float tolerances anywhere until the
final resampler output (also integer). Decode call graph (silk/):

  opus_decode_native -> silk_Decode (dec_API.c, 486 l): TOC->internal rate
    (NB 8k / MB 12k / WB 16k), stereo weights + MS->LR, resampling to API
    rate, PLC hookup
  -> silk_decode_frame (169 l)
     -> silk_decode_indices (decode_indices.c): VAD/LBRR flags ->
        signalType/quantOffset; gains (independent: silk_gain_iCDF[sig]
        MSB<<3 + uniform8 LSB; conditional: delta_gain); NLSF stage-1 idx
        (CB1_iCDF by sig>>1) + per-coef stage-2 via ec_iCDF[ec_ix] with
        NLSF_EXT extension at 0 / 2*QUANT_MAX; interp factor (20 ms only);
        voiced: pitch lag abs(hi*fs/2+lo)/delta, contour, LTP PERIndex +
        per-subframe LTPIndex, LTP_scaleIndex (independent only); LCG seed
        (uniform4)
     -> silk_decode_pulses (decode_pulses.c): rate level (by sig>>1),
        per-16-sample-block sum_pulses with LSB-extension chain (>16 =>
        nLshifts++, table row 9 (+1 to forbid extension at 10 LSBs)),
        shell decoder = fixed binary-split tree (tables 3->2->1->0),
        LSB bits per sample, signs (icdf built from silk_sign_iCDF
        [7*(2*sig+qoffset) + min(p,6)], value map 2*a-1)
     -> silk_decode_parameters (115 l): gains dequant (log domain),
        NLSF_decode -> NLSF2A -> LPC coefs Q12 (both interp halves),
        LTP coef table lookup, pitch lags from contour CB
     -> silk_decode_core (237 l): LCG noise injection at quantOffset,
        LTP filter (5-tap) + LPC synthesis (order 10/16) per subframe,
        Q14 excitation -> Q10 output, rewhitening on signal-type change
  -> stereo: silk_stereo_decode_pred + MS->LR (3-tap lowpass mix)
  -> resamplers (resampler.c + private_*): IIR+FIR fixed-point, 8/12/16k
     -> 48k output for the Opus layer

Order of implementation (each with a byte-exact fuzz oracle):
1. opus_silk_tables.hpp (generator running/DONE — see below).
2. Excitation: shell decoder + decode_pulses + decode_signs.
3. decode_indices (needs SideInfoIndices struct + decoder-state stubs).
4. NLSF_decode + NLSF2A (+ NLSF_unpack, bwexpander, LPC_inv_pred_gain
   stabilization chain) — isolated, ideal agent piece.
5. Gains dequant (log2lin etc.) + decode_parameters + decode_core.
6. decode_frame + silk_Decode + stereo + resamplers; CNG/PLC.
7. opus_decode_native integration (mode switch, redundancy) -> hybrid
   with CELT -> RFC test vectors 01-12 via opus_compare (O2 exit gate).

Key constants: SHELL_CODEC_FRAME_LENGTH 16 (LOG2 4), SILK_MAX_PULSES 16,
N_RATE_LEVELS 10, MAX_NB_SHELL_BLOCKS 20, MAX_LPC_ORDER 16,
NLSF_QUANT_MAX_AMPLITUDE 4, silk_dec_map(a) = 2a-1.

## O2 first bricks (2026-07-10): SILK tables + fixed-point kit DONE

- **src/opus_silk_tables.hpp** GENERATED by tools/gen_opus_silk_tables.py
  (all decoder tables incl. NLSF codebooks NB/MB+WB, pitch contours,
  shell-code rows, LSF cos table, resampler ROM; encoder-only tables
  skipped with the list documented in the header banner; iCDF rows and
  codebook shapes verified at gen time).
- **src/opus_silk_math.hpp**: the exact fixed-point kit (SMULWB/SMLAWB/
  SMULWW/SMMUL family, saturating adds/shifts, RSHIFT_ROUND, CLZ/CLZ_FRAC,
  DIV32_varQ / INVERSE32_varQ, lin2log/log2lin, silk_RAND). Gate:
  tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_math.py — 2M randomized operand sets,
  BYTE-IDENTICAL hash vs the reference inline kit. Two reconstruction
  bugs the gate caught immediately: the varQ Newton steps use SMMUL
  (>>32) + a (1<<29)-residual, and LSHIFT_SAT32 is clamp-THEN-shift
  (low bits zeroed), not saturate-to-MAX.

## O2 progress 2 (2026-07-10): excitation decoder DONE

opus_silk_excitation.{hpp,cpp}: rate level, per-block pulse counts with
LSB-extension chains, the fixed binary-split shell tree, LSB refinement,
signs (PDF by 7*(2*type+offset)+min(p,6), map 2a-1). Gate:
tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_exc.py — 300 fuzzed frames across all frame
lengths (80..320 incl. the 10ms@12k partial block) and signal/offset
types, pulses[] and tells BYTE-IDENTICAL. Note the tables agent's extra
gate: every generated table memcmp'd against libopus.a symbols (76/76).

NEXT in O2: decode_indices (needs SideInfoIndices + state struct),
NLSF_decode + NLSF2A chain (agent-suitable, isolated), gains dequant,
decode_parameters, decode_core (LPC/LTP synthesis — studied, see survey),
decode_frame + silk_Decode + stereo + resamplers, then hybrid + PLC +
RFC test vectors.

## O2 progress 3 (2026-07-10): side-info decode + gains + pitch lags DONE

opus_silk_indices.{hpp,cpp}: DecoderState (set_fs derives subframe/frame/
ltp-mem lengths, per-rate pitch iCDFs, NLSF codebook + LPC order),
SideInfoIndices (ZERO-INIT matters: fields not decoded for a frame type
persist, mirroring the reference state — the fuzz gate caught stale
garbage immediately), decode_indices (types, gains MSB+LSB / delta, two-
stage NLSF indices with rail escapes, interp factor, pitch abs/delta +
contour, LTP per-index + per-subframe + scaling, seed), nlsf_unpack,
gains_dequant (chain-limited, double-step escape, log2lin), decode_pitch
(contour codebooks, clamped). Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_indices.py
— 400 fuzzed sequences x 3 chained frames (cond coding, prev lag/type
carry), byte-identical incl. tells. NLSF chain (dequant/stabilize/NLSF2A)
in flight with its own gate.

## O2 progress 4 (2026-07-10): NLSF -> LPC chain DONE

opus_silk_nlsf.{hpp,cpp}: residual dequant (backwards prediction, Q10
dead-zone 102), stage-1 combination, nlsf_stabilize (20-round min-delta
repair + sort/clamp fallback), nlsf2a (cos-table interp, P/Q convolution
QA=16, lpc_fit Q17->Q12 with up-to-16-round chirp repair), bwexpander_32,
lpc_inverse_pred_gain (QA=24). Gate:
tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_nlsf.py — 2400 index vectors per path,
byte-identical, with instrumented proof the repair paths actually ran
(stabilize fallback 2080x, LPC_fit expansion 9108x, chirp rounds 19496x).
Math kit gained add_sat16 (gate re-run PASS).
Constants worth knowing: LPC_fit chirp = 65470 (0.999 Q16, NOT 65471);
lpc_inverse_pred_gain thresholds 16773022 (0.99975 Q24) / 107374
(1e-4 Q30) — float-rounded reference expressions.

Remaining in O2: decode_parameters + decode_core (synthesis loop),
decode_frame/silk_Decode + stereo + resamplers, hybrid, PLC, RFC vectors.

## O2 MILESTONE (2026-07-10): full SILK frame decode byte-identical

opus_silk_frame.{hpp,cpp}: decode_parameters (gain chain, NLSF->LPC for
both interpolation halves, LTP codebook taps <<7, pitch lags, LTP scale;
unvoiced zeroes controls AND resets PERIndex), decode_core (Q14 excitation
with LCG sign dither + level adjust + offsets, per-subframe gain-step state
rescaling via DIV32_varQ, voiced rewhitening through lpc_analysis_filter
at k==0 / k==2-with-interp incl. the LTP-scale downscaling on independent
frames, 5-tap LTP with +2 bias counter, order-10/16 LPC synthesis with
+order/2 bias counter, SAT16(RSHIFT_ROUND(SMULWW(.,gain_q10),8)) output),
bwexpander (ROUNDED multiplies on purpose — SMULWB bias destabilizes),
lpc_analysis_filter (wrapping accumulation per reference), decode_frame
(clean path + outBuf history shuffle).

Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_frame.py — 250 sequences x 4 chained
frames vs the REAL silk_decode_frame (incl. its PLC/CNG upkeep, proving
those are output-neutral on clean streams): xq PCM and tells
BYTE-IDENTICAL. PLC/CNG state upkeep still stubbed (documented in code);
becomes real work in the PLC item.

Remaining in O2: silk_Decode top level (frame-size/rate dispatch, stereo
weights + MS->LR unmix, resamplers to the API rate, LBRR/VAD header
flags), opus_decode_native integration + hybrid, PLC/CNG, RFC vectors.

## O2 progress 5 (2026-07-10): stereo layer DONE; resamplers in flight

opus_silk_stereo.{hpp,cpp}: stereo predictor decode (joint 5x5 MSBs +
uniform3/uniform5 fine, Q13 dequant with half-substep 6554 Q16, pred[0]
-= pred[1] for cascaded application), mid-only flag, MS->LR unmix
(2-sample carry, 8 ms predictor interpolation, 3-tap smoothed mid into
side, saturated L/R). Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_stereo.py — 300
sequences x 4 chained frames, byte-identical. Resampler module being
built in background with its own byte-exact gate.

Remaining in O2 after resamplers: silk_Decode top level (dec_API.c:
header flags VAD/LBRR per frame, frame-size dispatch, stereo glue incl.
mid-only handling, resample to API rate), opus_decode_native integration
+ hybrid (SILK + CELT in one ec), PLC/CNG, RFC test vectors.

## O2 MILESTONE 2 (2026-07-10): top-level SILK decoder byte-identical

- opus_silk_resampler.{hpp,cpp} (agent-built, mutant-tested gate): the
  four decode-reachable kernels (copy, up2_HQ, IIR_FIR, down_FIR) over
  all 15 (8/12/16 -> 8/12/16/24/48 kHz) pairs, byte-identical across 220
  chained blocks each. Invariants: ratio math on Hz with ROUND-UP Q16,
  first 1 ms flows through the delay-equalization buffer, down_FIR's
  batch loop exits on inLen > 1 (reference quirk, replicated).
- opus_silk_decoder.{hpp,cpp}: silk_Decode equivalent — VAD/LBRR header
  flags + LBRR distribution + LBRR skip-on-normal-decode, stereo pred/
  mid-only glue with the side-reset on mid-only transitions, per-channel
  frame decode with the conditional-coding rules (INDEP_NO_LTP_SCALING
  after skipped side frames), MS->LR or mono carry, resample to API rate,
  stereo_to_mono collapse handling, channel-transition state resets.
  DecoderState::set_fs now mirrors decoder_set_fs faithfully (guarded
  resets incl. LastGainIndex=10, lagPrev=100 on rate change; returns
  "resampler needs reinit").
- Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_silk_dec.py — 150 sequences x 3 packets
  with mono<->stereo/rate/duration changes at packet boundaries vs the
  reference silk_Decode: PCM and tells BYTE-IDENTICAL.
- Integration bug the gate caught instantly: passing api HZ where the
  resampler init takes KHZ — output lacked the resampler warm-up delay
  while tells still matched ("tell equal + PCM off from sample 1" =
  post-wire plumbing, same lesson family as the soft-clip story).

Remaining in O2: opus layer integration (SILK-only packets in
OpusDecoder; hybrid = SILK WB + CELT >=8k in ONE ec with the CELT start
band 17), PLC/CNG, then RFC test vectors 01-12 as the exit gate.

## O2 MILESTONE 3 (2026-07-10): full three-mode Opus decoding + 9/12 RFC vectors

- OpusDecoder now routes all TOC modes: SILK-only (0..11, internal rate
  from bandwidth, 40/60 ms via chained silk decodes), hybrid (12..15:
  SILK-WB + CELT start band 17 on the SAME range decoder), CELT-only.
  CELT endband by bandwidth incl. the MB->17 mapping.
- **Transition redundancy implemented** (the deferred machinery — real
  voip streams need it: the encoder appends a 5 ms CELT frame when
  switching modes). Hybrid flags it (bit_logp 12 + uint(256)+2 bytes);
  SILK-only IMPLIES it when >=17 bits remain after the SILK data (the
  tell-gate). RangeDecoder::shrink() cuts the redundant bytes from the
  main frame's budget. CELT->SILK: redundant frame continues the old CELT
  state and owns the first 2.5 ms + fade; SILK->CELT: fresh CELT state
  primed by the redundant frame + tail fade; final range = main ^
  redundant. CELT reset on mode switch is gated on !prev_redundancy.
  (Found via a single voip packet with a range mismatch — the last SILK
  packet before a CELT switch.)
- E2E gate now 38 configs incl. SILK NB/MB/WB 10-60 ms and hybrid
  SWB/FB: ALL final ranges exact; SILK-only PCM is BIT-EXACT (0 LSB),
  CELT/hybrid within 4 LSB.
- **Official RFC 6716/8251 test vectors (tools/test_opus_vectors.py):
  9/12 PASS via opus_compare, and 12/12 have ZERO range mismatches
  (23k+ packets)** — the whole wire decode is right; vectors 05/06/10
  fail only on PCM: they exercise NON-redundant mode transitions whose
  crossfades need PLC frames (SILK PLC + celt_decode_lost).

NEXT (the last O2 item): PLC/CNG (celt_decode_lost, silk PLC+CNG, DTX
zero-length frames, transition fades without redundancy) -> expect
12/12 vectors. Then O3 (Ogg) / O4 (CELT encoder).

## O2 COMPLETE (2026-07-10): RFC-CONFORMANT OPUS DECODER — 12/12 test vectors

**tools/test_opus_vectors.py: all 12 official RFC 6716/8251 test vectors
PASS the normative opus_compare procedure (97.1-100% quality), with ZERO
range mismatches across ~20k packets.** The clean-room decoder is
conformant.

Final pieces (this pass):
- SILK PLC + CNG (opus_silk_plc.{hpp,cpp}, agent-built): conceal/update/
  glue + comfort noise, byte-identical over 500 sequences with 605
  concealed frames. KEY reference corrections: PLC/CNG reset LAZILY on an
  fs mismatch inside silk_PLC/silk_CNG (decoder_set_fs does NOT reset
  them); init runs while frame_length==0 (pitch 0, gains 1.0, CNG seed
  3176576). decode_core's voiced-PLC->unvoiced patch writes into ctrl
  (the PLC update must see it).
- CELT PLC (in opus_celt_decoder.cpp, agent-built): noise/CNG branch +
  pitch-based branch (pitch_downsample/pitch_search/_celt_lpc ports;
  remove_doubling NOT needed), prefilter_and_fold, skip_plc, the
  loss-safety energy block. Two latent glint bugs found by its gate:
  background_log_e_ inits to 0 (NOT -28 — only oldLogE gets -28), and
  synthesis passed literal 0 for start (hybrid no-op until then).
- SilkDecoder::decode_lost (dec_API loss path: stored config, prev
  stereo predictors, has_side=!prev_decode_only_middle, LastGainIndex=10
  after loss, prev_decode_only_middle NOT updated).
- opus_decoder.cpp: full transition orchestration — concealment
  recursion for lost/DTX (F20 chunks, F10/F5 clamps), transition fade
  sources in the OLD mode, SILK reset on CELT->SILK, hybrid->SILK
  CELT-silence fade-out frame, gated celt_to_silk application, and the
  vector-10 lesson: **redundancy CANCELS the transition fade**
  (`if (redundancy) transition = 0`) and the SILK-side transition PLC
  decodes AFTER the redundancy parse. Found by bisecting vector 10 to 8
  diverging packets, all CELT->hybrid switches carrying redundancy.
- Final range convention: concealed frames report 0.

All gates green: 301/301 unit, every crosscheck_opus_*.py, E2E 38
configs, 12/12 vectors.

O2 leftovers for later polish: FEC (LBRR decode-on-request), DTX beyond
the per-frame conceal, decoder sample rates != 48k (API resampling
covers 8-48k in SILK; CELT downsample path unimplemented), OPUS_SET_GAIN.
NEXT: O3 (Ogg Opus demux -> decode .opus FILES) and/or O4 (CELT encoder).

## O3 DONE (2026-07-10): Ogg Opus — glint decodes .opus FILES

opus_ogg.{hpp,cpp}: Ogg page parse with CRC (0x04C11DB7 MSB-first, zero
init/xor, CRC field zeroed for the check), packet reassembly (lacing +
cross-page continuation, dangling-partial drop), OpusHead/OpusTags,
edit-list semantics (pre-skip front trim, last-granule end trim, Q7.8 dB
output gain). Mapping families 0 and 1 up to 2 channels (multistream
deferred). tools/opusfile_dec_cli.cpp = .opus -> int16 PCM.

Gate: tools/test_opus_ogg.py — 8 ffmpeg/libopus-encoded .opus configs
(SILK/hybrid/CELT, VBR+CBR, mono+stereo, 10-40 ms frames) decoded and
compared against ffmpeg FORCED to decode via libopus (its native opus
decoder differs at more LSBs): sample counts exact, PCM within 1 LSB.

MERGE CONDITION (user, 2026-07-10): decode + encode both proven correct
=> merge feature/opus to main. Decode side is done; O4 (CELT encoder)
is the remaining gate.

## O4 — CELT-only encoder (STARTED 2026-07-10): plan

This is the MERGE GATE: once the encoder is proven correct (its streams
decode with libopus AND glint's decoder, sane quality), feature/opus
merges to main.

Strategy (mirrors the MP3/AAC history: wire-correct first, quality
iterated later). CELT's implicit allocation means the encoder REUSES the
verified decoder machinery — the wire-coupled integer parts are already
byte-exact: RangeEncoder (O0), laplace_encode, encode_pulses/CWRS,
compute_allocation (needs an encode twin of the skip/intensity/dual
symbol I/O), tables, bits2pulses/caps.

Build order:
1. Forward MDCT (agent in flight): CeltImdct::forward vs
   clt_mdct_forward + TDAC round-trip gate.
2. EC-ref refactor: rate/bands take {RangeEncoder*, RangeDecoder*} so
   the same integer logic reads OR writes the skip/intensity/dual/theta
   symbols (reference uses an `encode` flag on one ec_ctx). Decode gates
   must stay green after the refactor.
3. Encoder-side energy: quant_coarse_energy (two-pass intra/inter with
   budget clamp), quant_fine_energy, quant_energy_finalise;
   amp2Log2/compute_band_energies/normalise_bands (float side).
4. Bands encode paths: alg_quant (op_pvq_search), stereo_split,
   intensity_stereo, stereo_itheta + theta encode, haar/collapse on the
   encode side of quant_band/partition/quant_all_bands.
5. celt_encode_with_ec top level, SIMPLE first: long blocks only
   (transient analysis later), spread normal, trim 5, no dynalloc, no
   prefilter (gain 0), CBR via padding/ec_enc_shrink (needs the O0
   leftovers ec_enc_shrink + ec_enc_patch_initial_bits). Output is a
   VALID stream at any quality.
6. Opus packetization (TOC + code 0) + Ogg mux (opus_ogg writer:
   OpusHead/OpusTags, lacing, granule, CRC) -> glint writes .opus.
7. Gates: (a) every stream decodes with libopus with zero errors +
   glint-decoder/libopus PCM agreement; (b) SNR/quality floor vs source;
   (c) league entry vs libopus/ffmpeg-native via tests/compare_encoders
   once quality work starts.
8. Quality iteration: transients+TF, pitch prefilter (search ported in
   PLC already), dynalloc, trim/spread analysis, VBR. League target:
   beat ffmpeg's native CELT encoder (realistic), approach libopus.

## O4 progress (2026-07-10): energy encoder + Ogg writer + allocator twin

- opus_celt_enc_energy.{hpp,cpp} (agent, byte-identical over 300
  scenarios/617 frames): band energies/amp2Log2/normalise + the full
  two-pass quant_coarse_energy (intra-vs-inter with badness metric +
  biased tell tiebreak, encoder-state snapshot + front-byte restore via
  the new RangeEncoder::buffer()), fine + finalise with error feedback.
- **CRITICAL BUILD INSIGHT: the prebuilt libopus.a is NOT
  float-reproducible** (FLOAT_APPROX celt_log2, NEON inner products, and
  clang FMA contraction inside quant_coarse_energy_impl). Encoder float-
  exactness gates must recompile the reference decision files with
  -ffp-contract=off and pin the glint side the same way. Corollary:
  glint's encoder under default flags is a VALID encoder that is not
  byte-identical to any particular libopus binary — validity (decodes
  correctly everywhere) never depends on flags; only the GATES do.
- Reference subtleties recorded: badness = sum|qi_ideal - qi_coded|,
  intra bias (budget*delayedIntra*loss_rate)/(C*512); max_decay =
  min(16, nbAvailableBytes/8) only when end-start>10 (3.0 for lfe),
  decay bound reads UNCLAMPED oldEBands while prediction uses the
  -9-clamped copy; error[] undefined outside [start,end); encoder budget
  must equal len*8 exactly or fallback thresholds desync.
- Ogg Opus WRITER (opus_ogg.cpp) + allocator encode twin: see commits.

## O4 MILESTONE (2026-07-10): glint ENCODES conformant Opus — MERGE GATE MET

- opus_celt_enc_bands.{hpp,cpp}: encoder-only float32 band coder
  (resynth=0 semantics: masks untransformed, no folding) —
  BYTE-IDENTICAL with libopus quant_all_bands(encode=1) over 150 fuzzed
  frames incl. transients/TF/stereo/hybrid.
- opus_celt_encoder.{hpp,cpp}: the simple-first top level (long blocks,
  no transient/tf/dynalloc/prefilter/intensity, trim 5, CBR), symbol
  sequence mirroring glint's own conformant decoder; preemphasis +
  forward MDCT (double, narrowed to float spectra — validity never
  depends on transform rounding) + the byte-exact layer stack.
- tools/opus_enc_cli.cpp writes opus_demo .bit with TOC + final ranges.
- **Gate (tools/test_opus_encoder.py): 8 configs (mono/stereo, 64-192k,
  2.5-20 ms) — libopus's own decoder VERIFIES our final ranges on every
  stream (the reference certifying our conformance), glint's decoder
  matches libopus within 3 LSB, SNR 20-29 dB.** Gotcha: the SNR must
  align for the 120-sample codec delay (a flat -4.5 dB smells like
  misalignment, not coding).
- Quality is intentionally untuned (analysis decisions are the knobs:
  transients+TF, dynalloc, trim/spread analysis, prefilter, intensity,
  VBR) — the league work comes after the merge.

**MERGE CONDITION SATISFIED: decode (12/12 RFC vectors) + encode
(libopus-certified streams) both correct.**

## O4 quality campaign — baseline (2026-07-10, post-merge)

Listening pack: /Users/christianstrobele/Downloads/glint_samples/
listening_opus/ (glint .opus files at 96/192k + libopus A/B + a
glint-decoded libopus stream + README with regeneration commands).

Delay-aligned SNR vs source, 60 s stereo clips, CBR (ffmpeg-native
column pending a fixed invocation — its output didn't decode):

| clip        | rate | glint | libopus |
|-------------|------|-------|---------|
| electronic  |  96k | 30.0  | 24.4    |
| electronic  | 192k | 34.9  | 26.9    |
| quartet     |  96k | 25.9  | 24.1    |
| quartet     | 192k | 30.4  | 27.5    |
| industrial  |  96k | 15.1  | 14.5    |
| industrial  | 192k | 21.7  | 20.1    |
| piano       |  96k | 18.5  | 22.9    |
| piano       | 192k | 24.0  | 28.1    |

Read: glint's untuned encoder is waveform-faithful (higher raw SNR on
3/4 clips — libopus spends bits perceptually, so judge by EAR/ODG, not
SNR; the MP3/AAC lesson applies). **Piano is the measured loss (-4.4/-4.1
dB): tonal content with note onsets — the pitch PREFILTER (search
already ported for PLC) + transient/TF analysis are the first two
campaign items.** Then: dynalloc, trim/spread analysis, intensity
stereo, VBR, and wiring `tests/compare_encoders.py --codec opus`
(ODG/PEAQ) for the league.

## O4 quality item 1 (2026-07-10): pitch PREFILTER — done

opus_celt_pitch.{hpp,cpp}: pitch chain shared out of the decoder's
PLC section (verbatim bodies, decoder keeps its verified local copies)
+ remove_doubling (sub-multiple disambiguation, fresh port) +
comb_filter_shared. Encoder: run_prefilter equivalent (unfiltered
prefilter_mem history, downsampled pitch search over 1024-45 lags,
remove_doubling with continuity, 0.7x gain, rate/continuity thresholds,
qg 3-bit quantization, comb with NEGATED gains + old->new fade), header
signaling with the reference's pitch_index+1 octave trick, state
rotation mirroring the decoder's postfilter.

Measured: gate tones +2..+2.6 dB; piano 18.5->19.1 (96k), 24.0->24.6
(192k); quartet/electronic unchanged (prefilter mostly off there). All
streams remain libopus-range-certified. Piano's remaining -3.8 dB gap
vs libopus = note-onset PRE-ECHO -> item 2 is transient analysis +
short blocks (the band encoder already passes its byte-exact gate WITH
transients; only the top-level analysis + short-MDCT + anti-collapse
bit are missing). Note: enc prefilter and dec postfilter fades are
offset by one short-MDCT by design — the synthesis delay aligns them.

## O4 quality item 2 (2026-07-10): transients + short blocks — done

Encoder: transient_analysis (reference float detector: HP filter
(1-2z^-1+z^-2)/(1-z^-1+.5z^-2), forward 0.0625 / backward 0.875-0.125
masking decay, inv-table harmonic-mean metric > 200), short-block
forward MDCT (M interleaved 120-pt transforms, shift=3, stride M),
transient wire bit, tf_encode transient logps (2/4), anti-collapse
reservation (lm>=2) + bit (consec_transient_ < 2), bands called with
short_blocks and the rsv-adjusted budget.

**The hard-won bug — tf_res must be REMAPPED, not just encoded.** The
reference's tf_encode ends with tf_res[i] =
tf_select_table[LM][4*isTransient+2*tf_select+tf_res[i]]; the decoder
derives tf_res = 1/2/3 (lm=1/2/3) on transient frames even when the
raw bits are all zero. Feeding quant_all_bands the raw zeros desyncs
the band recombine/theta symbols: streams stay VALID (libopus certifies
the ranges, both decoders agree — they share the decoded
interpretation) but transient frames decode as garbage. Gate signature:
"ranges ok, decoders agree, SNR -6..-13 dB". When ranges pass but
quality craters, suspect an encoder-internal desync between the
analysis passed to the band coder and what the decoder will derive
from the wire. Also: the tell+3 budget gate must be decided BEFORE the
MDCT (flag, interleave and tf derivation must agree).

Measured (castanets 60s stereo, NMR from tests/measure_audio.py):
96k mean NMR 22.8 -> 20.1 (p95 10.9 -> 9.5); 192k mean 8.4 -> 4.8
(p95 -1.9 -> -2.5, audible 4.3% -> 3.8%). SNR cost -0.1/-0.2 dB (by
design; judge transient work by NMR, not SNR). Piano unchanged
(19.1/24.6 — its gap is tonal-resolution, not pre-echo). Detector
fires 172/1000 castanets frames, 102/3000 piano, 1/100 gate-signal.
libopus castanets NMR (3.8 / -4.7) still ahead: that gap = tf_analysis
(per-band TF resolution), dynalloc, trim analysis -> next items.
GLINT_DBG_TRANSIENT=1 traces per-frame decisions.

## O4 quality item 3 (2026-07-10): tf_analysis (per-band TF resolution) — done

Reference port: transient_analysis now also outputs tf_estimate
(sqrt(max(0, .0069*min(163,tf_max)-.139))) and tf_chan; tf_analysis =
per-band L1-sparsity of Haar merge/split ladders (bias .04*max(-.25,
.5-tf_estimate), narrow-band half-point metric) + 2x selcost pass +
Viterbi smoothing with lambda = max(80, 20480/nbytes+2); tf_encode now
XOR-delta codes the REAL tf_res with the tf_changed-aware select-bit
condition, then remaps through tf_select_table (the item-2 lesson,
now exercised on both halves). Importance is uniform 13 (the
reference's lfe fallback) until dynalloc_analysis lands. Disabled below
15 bytes/channel like the reference.

Measured (delay-aligned SNR + NMR, 60s stereo): **castanets 96k mean
NMR 20.1 -> 2.2 (p95 9.5 -> 0.5, audible 8.7 -> 5.2%) — now AHEAD of
libopus (3.8); 192k 4.8 -> -8.2 (libopus -4.7), audible 3.8 -> 1.3%.**
SNR also up: 4.3 -> 4.9 / 12.4 -> 13.0 (libopus 5.0/13.0). Piano
19.1/24.6 unchanged (its gap is tonal resolution -> dynalloc/trim
next); electronic +0.2/+0.4 dB; quartet hold. Gate 8/8, all streams
libopus-range-certified. TF was the missing half of transient coding:
short blocks alone bought ~3 dB NMR, TF bought the next ~18.

## O4 quality item 4 (2026-07-10): alloc_trim analysis — done

alloc_trim_analysis (reference float path, no surround/tonality
analyzer): base 5 (4 below 64k equiv_rate, ramp to 5 by 80k), stereo
low-band correlation term (+max(-4, .75*log2(1.001-sum^2))), spectral
tilt of band log energies (-clamp((diff+1)/6, +-2)), -2*tf_estimate.
equiv_rate = (nbytes*8*50 >> (3-lm)) - (40C+20)*((400>>lm)-50).
Computed only when the 6-bit symbol fits, else the decoder default 5.

Measured: piano SNR 19.1 -> 21.1 (96k) / 24.6 -> 27.1 (192k) — the
libopus gap shrinks from -4.4 (baseline) to -1.8 dB — with NMR better
across the board (96k mean -3.3 -> -3.9, audible 12.5 -> 10.5%).
Electronic/quartet raw SNR drops 2-4 dB but NMR improves or holds
(electronic 96k audible 6.4 -> 2.2%, p95 +1.7 dB better): trim
redistributes bits perceptually — judge by NMR, same lesson as MP3
short blocks. Castanets holds. Gate 8/8, ranges libopus-certified.
Next: dynalloc_analysis (band importance + boosts; also feeds
tf_analysis importance), spread analysis, intensity stereo, VBR.

## O4 quality item 5 (2026-07-10): dynalloc_analysis + wire boosts — done

dynalloc_analysis (reference float path, CBR, no surround/tonality/
lfe): noise floor from kLogN/kEMeans/lsb_depth(16)/preemph tilt;
follower = fwd 1.5-dB + bwd 2-dB envelope bounded by the last band
rising >=.5 dB (bandlimited guard), median-of-5/3 filtered (offset 1),
floored at the noise floor; stereo 24-dB cross-talk merge; importance =
13*2^min(follower,4) (feeds tf_analysis — was uniform 13); CBR halves
follower on non-transient frames, <8 doubles, >=12 halves, cap 4;
per-band boost quanta with the 2/3-of-frame CBR cap. The dynalloc WIRE
loop now codes real flag chains (6-bit logp decaying to 1 after a hit,
next-band start at max(2, logp-1)); offsets[] leaves as eighth-bit
boosts, exactly what the conformant decoder derives. Trim gate now
subtracts total_boost (decoder decrements total_bits in place — the
encoder-side equivalent). band_log_e2 on transient frames = second
LONG-window MDCT energies + lm/2 dB (reference secondMdct semantics).

Measured vs trim-build: piano SNR +0.6/+0.6 (21.7/27.7 — libopus gap
now -1.2 dB, was -4.4 at baseline), electronic +0.2/+0.3, quartet
+0.1/+0.1, castanets flat (96k p95 -0.35 better / mean +0.24, audible
6.0 -> 5.8%; still ahead of libopus 3.8 mean / 3.7 p95). NMR flat
elsewhere. Gate 8/8, ranges libopus-certified. spread_weight[] is
computed and ready for the spread-analysis item.

## O4 quality item 6 (2026-07-10): spread + tapset analysis — done

spreading_decision port (bands.c): per-band |x|^2*N sparsity CDF
weighted by dynalloc's spread_weight, recursive tonal_average,
hysteresis vs last decision -> SPREAD_{NONE,LIGHT,NORMAL,AGGRESSIVE};
HF sparsity average drives tapset_decision (0/1/2), consumed by the
PREFILTER one frame later (reference lag). Transient/tiny frames force
NORMAL. Encoder-side spread mirrors the decoder default (NORMAL) when
the 4-bit symbol doesn't fit — the reference itself can desync there.
State: tonal_average_=256, hf_average_=0, tapset_decision_=0.

Measured: metrics FLAT on all 4 clips at both rates (<=0.06 dB NMR) —
the decision is genuinely active (quartet 60% AGGRESSIVE, electronic
48%; tapset stays 0 on these dark clips) but rotation choice barely
moves our metrics; it should matter for ODG/listening on sparse tonal
content. Gate 8/8. Remaining O4: intensity stereo, VBR, ODG league
(compare_encoders --codec opus), listening-pack refresh.

## O4 quality item 7 (2026-07-10): intensity + dual-stereo decisions — done

stereo_analysis (L1 entropy of L/R vs M/S over the first 13 bands,
0.707107 M/S scale, theta-cost handicap (eBands[13]<<(LM+1))+13 (-8 at
LM<=1); dual_stereo forced 0 at LM=0) + intensity via
hysteresis_decision(equiv_rate/1000) over the reference 21-entry
threshold/hysteresis tables, clamped [start,end], persistent
intensity_ state. Both flags are wire-coded by compute_allocation (the
machinery was already conformant); alloc_trim_analysis now gets the
real intensity for its minXC loop. equiv_rate hoisted for both uses.

Measured: piano SNR 21.7 -> 22.4 (96k) / 27.7 -> 28.5 (192k) AND NMR
better (mean -3.89 -> -4.25, audible 10.6 -> 9.1%; 192k audible 0.1 ->
0.0%) — dual_stereo fires on piano where L/R is sparser than M/S.
**Piano gap vs libopus now -0.5 dB (was -4.4 at the campaign start).**
Quartet -0.2 SNR / NMR flat; electronic/castanets flat. Gate 8/8.
At 96k stereo equiv_rate=96 -> intensity band 19 (top two bands
intensity-coded); 192k -> 21 = off.

O4 remaining: VBR, ODG league (compare_encoders --codec opus),
listening-pack refresh. Then O5 polish (FEC, multistream, 24k out,
OPUS_SET_GAIN).

## O4 quality item 8 (2026-07-10): unconstrained VBR — done

compute_vbr port (float path, no tonality analyzer/surround/lfe —
their boosts don't apply, incl. pitch_change which only lives inside
the analyzer branch): base = vbr_rate - (40C+20)<<3; stereo-savings
rebate (max_frac=0.8*dof/bins, saving from trim analysis' logXC2,
persistent stereo_saving_ member); dynalloc boost (analysis-side
tot_boost, NOT the wire loop's) - 19<<lm calibration; transient boost
(tf_estimate-0.044)*target; depth floor min(target, (C*bins<<3)*
maxDepth) with maxDepth from dynalloc_analysis; temporal VBR below
96k for tf_estimate<0.2 (band-envelope follower vs persistent
spec_avg_, clamp [-1.5,3]); cap 2*base. Packet size = clamp(target+
tell_frac rounded, [min_allowed = written+wire_boost+2B, cap]);
ec shrink() moves raw bits to the new end. effective_bytes (=vbr_rate
>>6) drives the analysis budgets (dynalloc floor, tf lambda, prefilter
enable) instead of the cap. API: CeltEncoder::set_vbr(bps), CLI
`opus_enc_cli ... out.bit vbr`; gate has 3 VBR cases (11/11 PASS).

Measured (avg rates: piano 95.9/191.2, quartet 93.1, castanets 89.1,
electronic 81.9 at 96k target — libopus's own VBR does 73.9 on
electronic, 101-106 on quartet/castanets, so the undershoot is
reference depth-floor behavior, not a bug): **castanets 96k SNR 5.0 ->
12.8 (+7.8 dB at FEWER bits than CBR), NMR mean 3.7 -> 1.7 / p95 1.9
-> -1.6, audible 5.8 -> 4.1%; 192k NMR -5.2 -> -11.1, audible 2.0 ->
0.1%.** Piano flat at on-target rate. Electronic/quartet NMR softer at
their lower spent rates (equal-bits comparisons need matched targets).
CBR path byte-unchanged (gate values identical).

O4 remaining: ODG league (compare_encoders --codec opus), listening
pack refresh. Then O5 polish (FEC encode, multistream, 24k out,
OPUS_SET_GAIN, Ogg VBR mux uses actual packet sizes already).

## O4 ODG league (2026-07-10) — DONE (tests/opus_league_2026-07-10.txt)

`tests/compare_encoders.py --codec opus`: glint CBR+VBR (opus_enc_cli +
opus_mux_cli chain, now CMake targets `opus_enc_cli`/`opus_mux_cli`) vs
libopus VBR+CBR (ffmpeg -c:a libopus) + lame-q2 MP3 anchor, Ogg .opus
wire, 10 clips x {96, 192} kbps, ODG/MOS/NMR/PESQ/STOI.

Best-glint vs best-libopus ODG at 96k: WIN castanets (-0.06 vs -0.15,
best in table), quartet (-0.55 vs -0.58), drums (-0.86 vs -0.91);
TIE speech (-0.61 =), electronic (-0.00 vs +0.05), industrial,
orchestral (-0.74 vs -0.72); LOSE piano (-1.23 vs -0.58) and torture
(-1.84 vs -0.76) — both are the tonality-analyzer VBR boosts we don't
have. choir: libopus MISBEHAVES (SNR 13 dB, MOS 4.30 vs glint 4.63 —
its mode machinery, not ours). At 192k every opus entry is
ODG-transparent (+-0.1) except torture (libopus edges); glint holds
the highest raw SNR on most clips and is often ~1.5-2x faster.

Remaining gap = tonality analysis (piano/torture 96k VBR boosts).
Listening pack refreshed with the tuned encoder + VBR variants
(listening_opus/*_glint_vbr96k.opus).

## O4 tonality analysis (2026-07-10) — done (the last analyzer block)

src/opus_analysis.{hpp,cpp}: reduced port of the reference
tonality_analysis (src/analysis.c float path) — FFT-phase-
predictability tonality per bin (480-pt FFT at 24 kHz packing TWO
240-offset windows as real/imag; fast_atan2f kept — the metric was
tuned with it), band tonality with stationarity memory, tonality_slope,
activity (noisiness + relativeE trackers), leak_boost ladders
(LEAKAGE_SLOPE 2/oct-ish, OFFSET 2.5). The music/speech MLP, bandwidth
detector and BFCC features are NOT ported — no consumer needs them.
The analysis window is generated (sin^2(pi(i+1)/480) matches the
reference table). Input: mono mean downmixed at +-1 scale through the
analysis.c-local float down2_hp resampler (2 all-pass sections). Reuses
CeltImdct::MixedFft (made public) with explicit 1/N kiss scaling.
Consumers: dynalloc follower += leak_boost/64; trim -= 2*(slope+.05)
clamped; compute_vbr activity reduction + 1.2*tonal boost +
pitch_change kick (gain>.4, tonality>.3, pitch jump >26%).

Measured: **VBR rates now track libopus almost exactly** (96k target:
electronic 73.7 vs libopus 73.9, quartet 100.9 vs 101.3, castanets
107.4 vs 106.3; piano earns 113.7 — the tonal boost). League rows:
**piano 96k glint-vbr ODG -1.24 -> -0.77** (2nd place, ahead of
libopus-cbr -1.03; libopus-vbr -0.58), **torture 96k glint-cbr -1.84
-> -0.92** / vbr -2.49 -> -1.22 (libopus -0.76/-0.85) — the two league
losses are now near-parity. Piano 96k VBR audible band-frames 9.0 ->
3.8%. CBR clip SNRs +-0.3 dB. Gate 11/11, ranges libopus-certified.

# Opus O5 polish

## O5.1 (2026-07-10): SILK in-band FEC decode — done

OpusDecoder::decode_fec(data, len, pcm, frame_size): recover a LOST
packet from the NEXT packet's LBRR copy (plain PLC when data is null /
no usable FEC: CELT-only packet or mode, frame_size < packet duration).
SilkDecoder::decode(..., fec): reference FLAG_DECODE_LBRR semantics —
header flags read as usual, LBRR skip loop bypassed, stereo predictors
only when this frame HAS an LBRR copy (else pred_prev), has_side from
prev_decode_only_middle OR the side channel's LBRR flag, condCoding
from the PREVIOUS frame's LBRR flag, per-frame "LBRR flag 0 => PLC"
fallback inside decode_frame (which now threads lbrr into
decode_indices). LastGainIndex=10 clamp stays PLAIN-loss-only.

Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_fec.py (dual-compiled driver, deterministic
20% xorshift loss, FEC+PLC+normal interleaving): **BYTE-IDENTICAL PCM +
ranges vs libopus on SILK-only WB streams, mono and stereo (301
packets, 50 FEC recoveries each)**; mode-switching (hybrid) stream:
ranges identical, PCM within 256 (worst 217 ~ -44 dBFS concealment
noise; the CELT half is float and never byte-exact). 12/12 RFC vectors
and E2E still pass.

**The hard-won bug — CELT PLC needs the band range EVERY call.** The
reference issues CELT_SET_START_BAND/END_BAND ctls before every celt
call INCLUDING loss concealment; glint's CeltDecoder::decode_lost used
the band range of the last DECODED frame. First hybrid FEC after a
SILK-only run resets the CELT state (mode switch) and then concealed
with the default range [0,21) — the noise-based PLC floor
(max(backgroundLogE=0, oldE-decay) = 0 in the eMeans log domain, NOT
silence!) sprayed band-0..21 noise at -30 dBFS over the SILK output.
decode_lost now takes start/end (hybrid 17, CELT 0) like the ctls.
Debug signature: FEC output plausible-but-loud, ranges fine, plain PLC
byte-exact. Driver lesson: match FLOAT2INT16 exactly (float multiply +
lrintf; double lrint rounds differently at half-LSB points).

## O5.2: output gain — ALREADY DONE (no work needed)

The RFC 7845 OpusHead Q7.8 dB output gain has been parsed
(OggOpusReader::head), exposed (output_gain()) and applied
(tools/opusfile_dec_cli.cpp) since the Ogg layer landed — the
equivalent of libopus OPUS_SET_GAIN for the .opus file path. Remaining
O5: multistream/surround (mapping family 1), non-48k decoder output
rates (SILK side is trivial — the resampler takes api_hz; CELT needs
the reference's downsample-by-N in the synthesis path).

## League-refresh note (2026-07-10 late)

A full 10-clip ODG re-run with the tonality build was attempted and
abandoned: the machine is under heavy external load (loadavg ~45;
peaqb/visqol run 5-10x slower than the 18:52 baseline league). The
material tonality-build deltas ARE measured and recorded above (piano
96k vbr ODG -1.24 -> -0.77, torture cbr -1.84 -> -0.92, VBR rates
tracking libopus within ~0.5 kb/s); the committed full table
(tests/opus_league_2026-07-10.txt) otherwise predates the tonality
port — its glint-vbr rows understate the current encoder on tonal
content. Re-run `compare_encoders.py --codec opus --bitrates 96 192`
on an idle machine to refresh the record.

## O5.3 (2026-07-10): non-48k decoder output rates — done

OpusDecoder::init(channels, fs) with fs in {8,12,16,24,48} kHz
(reference downsample factors 6/4/3/2/1). SILK resamples straight to
fs (a matching internal rate means NO resampling — and the whole SILK
chain stays exact integer at every api rate). CELT synthesizes at
48 kHz as always; denormalise_bands clamps its spectral bound to
n/downsample (band-limit BEFORE synthesis so decimation cannot alias,
reference semantics) and the de-emphasis stage keeps every
downsample-th sample. The opus layer runs control flow in 48k units
and pcm positions in output units; smooth_fade samples the 48k CELT
window with stride ds (reference window[i*inc]). decode()/decode_fec()
sample counts are output-rate units, like the reference API.

Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_rates.py (reuses the FEC driver, which now
takes an fs argument, 20% loss pattern still active): **SILK-only WB
streams BYTE-IDENTICAL to libopus at all five rates (301 packets each,
including PLC and FEC recoveries)**; CELT-only streams: ranges
identical, steady-state decoded frames within 3-4 LSB at every rate.
Two measured non-bugs worth remembering: (1) the CELT pitch-PLC runs
an LPC feedback loop on band-limited history at ds>1, where our
double vs the reference's float drifts up to ~118 LSB on CONCEALED
frames (decoded frames unaffected; the RFC vectors themselves gate
PLC by quality metric, not bits); (2) the first good frame after a
loss overlaps the concealment's synthesis memory and inherits its
divergence — the gate bounds it with the concealment tolerance.
12/12 vectors, e2e and the FEC gate all still pass at 48 kHz.

O5 remaining: multistream/surround (mapping family 1).

## O4 league REFRESH with the tonality build (2026-07-11) —
## tests/opus_league_2026-07-11.txt

Full 10-clip x {96,192k} re-run (same harness; MOS included). Best
glint entry vs best libopus entry by ODG at 96k:
- **WIN castanets (glint-vbr +0.06, best in table; libopus-vbr
  -0.15), quartet (-0.55 vs -0.58), drums (-0.88 vs -0.91), choir
  (nominal ODG tie -2.46/-2.42 but MOS 4.62 vs 4.32 and SNR 20.8 vs
  13.2 — libopus's mode machinery misbehaves there, not ours).**
- TIE speech (-0.60 vs -0.61), electronic (-0.02 vs +0.05),
  industrial (-0.44 vs -0.43), orchestral (-0.73 vs -0.72).
- LOSE piano (glint-vbr -0.77 vs libopus-vbr -0.58; was -1.24 before
  tonality) and torture (glint-cbr -0.92 vs libopus-vbr -0.76; was
  -1.84) — both gaps now < 0.2 ODG.
At 192k every opus entry is transparent (|ODG| <= 0.15, no losses);
glint holds the top raw SNR/NMR on most clips (electronic +5.7 dB SNR
over libopus, torture +5.0, quartet +1.5) and glint-vbr ties or beats
libopus-vbr on ODG everywhere. Bottom line: **4 wins / 4 ties / 2
narrow losses at 96k; parity-or-better at 192k** — a clean-room
encoder written in four days trading blows with libopus 1.5.2.

## O5.4 (2026-07-11): multistream/surround decode — done (O5 COMPLETE)

- opus_packet_parse_ext(data, len, self_delimited, pkt, &packet_offset):
  RFC 6716 appendix B self-delimited framing (explicit last-frame size;
  for CBR it applies to every frame; packet_offset = header + frames +
  padding so the next stream's packet starts there). Regular parse is
  now a wrapper — vectors/e2e confirm no regression.
- src/opus_ms_decoder.{hpp,cpp}: OpusMsDecoder (RFC 7845 mapping family
  1, up to 8 channels): streams 0..N-2 self-delimited, coupled stream s
  feeds mapping indices {2s, 2s+1}, mono stream s feeds coupled+s,
  mapping 255 mutes; final_range = XOR across streams (reference
  convention). Reuses OpusDecoder via the new decode_parsed() (decode a
  pre-parsed packet — the reference threads self_delimited into
  opus_decode_native instead).
- OggOpusReader: family-1 header fully parsed (stream/coupled counts +
  mapping table, channels <= 8); family 0 fills the trivial layout.
  opus_ms_extract tool dumps layout+packets for the gate.

Gate: tools/crosscheck_opus_ms.py — ffmpeg-encoded 5.1 and quad
family-1 files, dual-compiled driver vs libopus
opus_multistream_decode_float: **XOR'd final ranges identical (201
packets each — exact proof the self-delimited split and per-stream
decode match), PCM within 1 LSB.** Per-channel distinct tones make
mapping mistakes loud. Full decoder regression green (12/12 vectors,
e2e, FEC, rates, ogg).

**The Opus roadmap (O0-O5) is COMPLETE**: RFC-conformant decoder
(SILK+CELT+hybrid, PLC/CNG, FEC, multistream, 8-48k output, Ogg
read/write, output gain) + a CELT encoder trading blows with libopus
(4 wins / 4 ties / 2 narrow losses at 96k ODG). Possible future work
is quality iteration (piano/torture tonality gap), SILK/hybrid
ENCODING, DTX, and multistream encode — all beyond the original scope.

# ABI + wrappers (2026-07-11)

## Opus wired into the C ABI and all three bindings — done

- include/glint/glint.h: glint_opus_enc_* (CELT encoder, CBR/VBR,
  emits complete TOC+payload packets), glint_opus_dec_* (full decoder:
  decode, decode_fec/PLC, final_range, output rates 8-48k),
  glint_opus_ms_dec_* (surround family 1). Impl in src/opus_c_api.cpp.
- Unit suite grew 301 -> 365 checks: the C-API round-trip asserts the
  **final-range conformance identity on every packet** (encoder range
  == decoder range — needs no external oracle), FEC/PLC entry, 16 kHz
  output length, multistream wrapper, and hand-built self-delimited
  packet-parse vectors (incl. truncation rejection).
- Python (ctypes): OpusEncoder/OpusDecoder classes + 3 unittest cases
  (16/16 pass). Rust: glint-sys externs + safe OpusEncoder/OpusDecoder
  + cargo test (5/5) — also fixed the stale build.rs source list
  (compiled 7 MP3 files only; AAC/psycho/Opus were declared but
  unlinkable) and added the missing `[lib] name = "glint"`. Dart:
  GlintOpusEncoder/GlintOpusDecoder + example/opus_roundtrip.dart
  (5/5 range matches) — also replaced the hand-rolled _Calloc (broken
  on modern Dart SDKs: generic sizeOf<T> is no longer legal) with
  package:ffi's calloc.

# MP3 + AAC-LC DECODER track (next major work)

Feasible and well-prepared: both wire formats, all Huffman tables
(prefix-freeness unit-verified), scalefactor semantics and transforms
already live in this repo from the encoder work.

- D1 MP3 decoder: header/side-info/scalefactor parse (incl. LSF sfc
  mapping), bit-reservoir reassembly, Huffman decode (reuse
  tables::huff), requantize x^(4/3) (reuse pow tables), stereo modes
  (MS/intensity), alias reduction, 36/12-pt IMDCT + window sequences
  (encoder MDCT's adjoint), polyphase synthesis filterbank (adjoint of
  src/subband.cpp). Gates: round-trip our own encoder at all rates
  (SNR floors), decode LAME/ffmpeg streams vs ffmpeg/CoreAudio decode
  (tolerance), ISO compliance bounds (RMS error per ISO 11172-4 if
  vectors available).
- D2 AAC-LC decoder (ADTS): ADTS/ICS parse, sectioning+Huffman decode
  (aac tables), inverse quant + scalefactors, M/S, TNS synthesis
  filter (inverse lattice), IMDCT for all 4 window sequences +
  overlap-add. Gates: round-trip glint-aac output, decode
  afconvert/fdk streams vs ffmpeg decode.
- Then: C ABI (glint_mp3_dec_*/glint_aac_dec_*) + wrappers, mirroring
  the Opus pattern.

## D1 MP3 decoder — done (2026-07-11)

src/mp3_decoder.{hpp,cpp}: full MPEG-1 + MPEG-2/2.5 LSF Layer III
decoder. Header/side-info parse (both layouts), bit reservoir
(main_data_begin history, zero-output until satisfied), scalefactors
(MPEG-1 slen pairs + scfsi; LSF 4-slen band groups for all 6
blocknumbers incl. the intensity variants), Huffman decode via trees
BUILT AT RUNTIME FROM THE ENCODER'S OWN CODE TABLES (tables.hpp — the
two sides cannot drift), requantize (x^4/3, pretab, subblock_gain),
short-block reorder, MS + intensity stereo (MPEG-1 tan-ratio and LSF
io^((pos+1)/2)), alias reduction, 36/12-pt IMDCT with all four window
types + mixed blocks, overlap-add + frequency inversion, polyphase
synthesis (DCT-32 + the tabulated window — which turned out to BE the
ISO D synthesis table, hence its name analysis_window_d; the first
smoke test showed an exact 32.000x output ratio from assuming D=32C).

Gate: tools/test_mp3_decoder.py (ctest: mp3_decoder_vs_ffmpeg) —
**13/13 streams at 128-131 dB agreement with ffmpeg**: glint
speed/normal/best x stereo/joint, castanets short blocks, VBR, mono,
MPEG-2 22.05k, and LAME 128k/castanets/V4-VBR/m2 (foreign encoder:
scfsi, different table choices, nonzero subblock_gain, preflag). A
real-world 1-min 48k file decodes 2500/2500 frames at 129.1 dB.

Hard-won details:
- **The short-block sfb table has 13 bands** (boundary [13] = 192): the
  sfb21-equivalent tail (lines 3*136..575) IS coded by real encoders
  (LAME bv up to 264 pairs). Looping bands to <12 zeroed those lines:
  the exact signature was ~35 dB ONLY on LAME transient frames while
  glint's own short blocks (which never code the tail) passed at
  128 dB.
- ffmpeg applies gapless trims from Xing/Info/LAME tags that a raw
  frame decoder cannot know; the gate strips the metadata frame before
  feeding BOTH decoders (glint's own VBR Xing frame produced a
  19 dB slow-converging "mismatch" that was pure warm-up/trim skew —
  stripped, the same stream matches at 130.8 dB).
- MPEG-1 window-switching region0 ends at 36 LINES for all rates and
  block types; LSF start/stop granules use 54 (matches the encoder
  invariant).
Intensity stereo is now covered (2026-07-11): no encoder in the wild
emits IS, so tools/gen_mp3_intensity.py hand-builds VALID IS frames
(dynamic part2_3, table-1 big_values, right scalefactors as intensity
positions) and the gate checks glint == ffmpeg on 5 variants
(whole-spectrum + mid-band bounds, MS+IS combined, is_pos=7 fallback)
at ~126 dB. Gate is now 19/19. Next: D2 AAC-LC decoder, then C ABI +
wrappers for both.

## D2 AAC-LC decoder — done (2026-07-11)

src/aac_decoder.{hpp,cpp}: full ADTS AAC-LC decoder. ADTS parse,
raw_data_block (SCE/CPE/FIL/END), ics_info (all 4 window sequences +
short grouping), section_data, scale_factor_data (three interleaved
DPCM chains: normal / intensity positions / PNS noise energies), TNS
data, spectral Huffman (books 1-11 via runtime trees from the ENCODER's
code tables, book-11 escape), inverse quant (|ix|^4/3 * 2^(0.25(sf-100))),
PNS (book 13, decoder-random noise normalized to band energy),
intensity stereo (books 14/15), M/S, TNS synthesis (all-pole inverse of
the encoder's forward FIR), and the IMDCT/window/overlap-add for long,
start, eight-short and stop sequences. Output normalized 1/32768 to +-1
(the encoder works in int16 PCM scale — the first smoke test showed the
exact 32768x ratio, same tell as MP3's 32x).

Gate: tools/test_aac_decoder.py (ctest: aac_decoder_vs_ffmpeg), two
tiers because AAC PNS samples are decoder-random by design:
- **glint roundtrip** (glint never emits PNS/IS): SNR vs ffmpeg,
  excluding 2 warm-up + 6 flush-tail frames (the encoder-flush tail's
  exact reconstruction is flush-dependent). **noise/short-heavy 134.9
  dB, stereo tonal 109.8, mono 94.1, transient 86.4** — essentially
  bit-accurate across long/start/short/stop, M/S and TNS.
- **foreign streams** (ffmpeg / fdkaac / afconvert, which DO use PNS):
  zero decode errors + mean-log-magnitude-spectrum correlation
  (0.95/0.999/0.995 — PNS preserves per-band energy so the time-
  averaged spectrum matches) + a loose total-energy ratio (0.4-2.5;
  FDK lands at 1.85 — a decoder-defined PNS-energy-convention
  difference, not a structural bug: its spectrum correlates at 0.994).

Hard-won details:
- ffmpeg/fdk/apple emit PNS (book 13) and all window sequences even on
  simple content; glint's own encoder uses books 1-11 only, so the
  roundtrip tier is the precision oracle and foreign streams validate
  structure under PNS randomness.
- M/S flags are in the CPE ELEMENT header (right after ms_mask_present),
  BEFORE the two channel bodies — not after. Decode order undoes M/S
  before TNS (encoder did TNS on L/R then M/S) and before intensity
  (right IS band = sign * 2^(0.25*is_pos) * left, sign from book
  15/14 flipped by M/S).
- Per-frame SNR localizes edge effects: 137 dB steady, one bad tail
  frame dominated the naive global SNR (5 dB) until the flush tail was
  excluded.

Next: C ABI (glint_mp3_dec_* / glint_aac_dec_*) + Python/Rust/Dart
wrappers, mirroring the Opus decoder pattern.

## Decoder C ABI + wrappers (2026-07-11) — done

- include/glint/glint.h: glint_mp3_dec_* / glint_aac_dec_* +
  glint_{mp3,aac}_frame_info + a shared glint_dec_frame_info struct.
  Impl src/decoder_c_api.cpp. Interleaved-float output; the MP3 decoder
  keeps its reservoir across calls (may return 0 samples early).
- Unit suite 365 -> 379: encode a tone through the public MP3/AAC
  ENCODER, walk frames via *_frame_info, decode through *_decode, check
  the roundtrip sample count + energy.
- Python: Mp3Decoder/AacDecoder (decode_frame + whole-stream decode,
  ID3v2 skip, numpy or list output). Rust: Mp3Decoder/AacDecoder via a
  frame_decoder! macro + cargo test roundtrip (build.rs source list
  re-synced to 42 files). Dart: GlintMp3Decoder/GlintAacDecoder +
  example/decoder_roundtrip.dart. All verified end to end.

The MP3+AAC codecs are now COMPLETE both ways (encode + decode) with C
ABI + Python/Rust/Dart bindings, matching the Opus track's shape.


## AAC decoder IMDCT speedup (2026-07-11)

The AAC decoder shipped with a direct O(N^2) IMDCT (48 s to decode 30 s
of stereo — sub-realtime). Replaced with a fast FFT-based IMDCT
(src/aac_decoder.cpp ImdctPlan): the decoder IMDCT and the encoder's
forward MDCT are a proven perfect-reconstruction pair (aac_mdct.cpp),
so the fast path inverts the encoder's exact pipeline — undo
post-twiddle, Q=N/4 radix-2 complex FFT (precomputed bit-reversal +
twiddles), undo pre-twiddle to recover the folded u, unfold via the
measured TDAC symmetry (region B x[n]=-x[2Q-1-n], region A
x[3Q+n]=x[3Q-1-n]). Derived and verified in a standalone harness
(fast vs direct rel-err 2e-13 for N=2048 and 256).

Result: **403x faster per transform; 30 s stereo now decodes in 0.06 s
(~440x realtime, was 48 s)**; decoder output 232.7 dB identical to the
direct version; gate + unit suite unchanged.

## Second reference decoder — Apple CoreAudio cross-check (2026-07-11)

ISO 14496-4 AAC conformance vectors are not freely available (ISO sells
them; none in this environment). The achievable "external reference
beyond ffmpeg" is a SECOND independent decoder: Apple CoreAudio via
afconvert (-f WAVE -d LEF32), which decodes both ADTS AAC and MP3.

- AAC gate (hard): glint roundtrip streams (no PNS) now checked vs BOTH
  ffmpeg AND CoreAudio — glint matches both at 86-135 dB (tonal 109.8
  vs ffmpeg / 109.8 vs Apple; noise 134.9 / 134.4). Two independent
  ISO decoders agreeing with glint is stronger than ffmpeg alone.
- MP3 gate (advisory): CoreAudio agrees ~82 dB on glint stereo streams
  but its config-dependent priming/gapless trims make mono/VBR
  alignment unreliable (MP3 decoders are not bit-exact by spec), so the
  Apple MP3 number is reported, not gated; ffmpeg (130 dB) stays the
  hard MP3 oracle.

## O4 piano/torture tonality gap — investigated, diminishing returns (2026-07-11)

The two 96k ODG losses (piano -0.77 vs libopus -0.58, torture -0.92 vs
-0.76) were probed after the tonality port. Findings (piano 96k VBR,
glint 113.7 vs libopus 112.8 kb/s — SAME rate, so it's ALLOCATION
efficiency, not bits):
- Per-band: glint under-allocates 0-8 kHz (~-1 dB SNR vs libopus) and
  over-allocates 8-16 kHz (+1 dB). Looked like an alloc_trim tilt.
- **alloc_trim probe**: LOWERING trim (more LF bits) made NMR WORSE
  (-5.84 -> -5.50 at bias -1) — glint's HF bits are well-spent per NMR;
  trim is not the lever. glint already picks trim 7 (of 10) on 88% of
  piano frames, matching the reference formula.
- **Transient sensitivity** (mask_metric threshold 200 -> 120): flat on
  piano (-5.84 -> -5.82) — onsets aren't the p95 driver.
- **Dynalloc boost x2**: +0.09 dB piano (-5.84 -> -5.93), quartet
  unchanged — real but negligible, and deviating from the reference
  follower*1.0 for 0.09 dB isn't worth the cross-clip regression risk.

Conclusion: the residual ~0.9 dB NMR gap is libopus's mature,
MLP-refined allocation tuning that no single CELT knob captures (the
music/speech MLP mainly steers MODE decisions, not CELT allocation, so
porting it is high-effort/low-CELT-reward). glint is competitive:
wins/ties 8/10 clips at 96k ODG, transparent at 192k. Every CELT
analysis block the reference uses IS ported. Marked diminishing-returns;
the encoder is unchanged (all probes were env-gated and removed).

## Decoder robustness / fuzz-hardening (2026-07-11)

Real decoders must not crash, read/write out of bounds, or hang on
malformed input. Fuzzed the MP3 + AAC decoders under
AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (tools/fuzz_decoders.cpp,
gate tools/test_decoder_fuzz.py, ctest decoder_fuzz) with random /
bit-flipped-valid / truncated streams. Bugs found and fixed (all in
src/aac_decoder.cpp; MP3 was already clean — 88k calls, 101M samples,
no error):
- **Infinite loop (DoS)**: section_data spun forever when a corrupt/
  exhausted stream yielded len_sect == 0 (filled never advanced). Fixed
  with a must-advance check + a BitReader overrun flag bailed on across
  the section, element, and spectral loops.
- **Heap overflow**: a corrupt ADTS channel_config claiming >2 channels
  reached the fixed-width PCM interleave (pcm[n*channels_+ch]). Reject
  channels != 1,2 (mono/stereo only) + clamp the write width.
- **Stack overflow**: a corrupt TNS order (5-bit, up to 31) overflowed
  the order-13 LPC scratch arrays. Clamp to the LC max (12 long / 7
  short).
- **Global overflow / OOB read**: reserved codebook 12 fell through to
  kBookDim[11] / g_spec[11] (both size 11). Reject cb == 12 in sections
  + skip bk >= 12 in spectral decode.
After fixes: both decoders survive ~190k decode calls / 200M samples of
malformed input with ZERO ASan/UBSan reports; all decode gates + 379
unit tests unchanged (fixes are no-ops on valid streams).

The **Opus decoder** was fuzzed too (tools/fuzz_opus_decoder.cpp, added
to the same gate): **1,040,000 random + bit-flipped/truncated decode
calls under ASan with no crash / OOB / hang** — memory-safe (as the
existing libopus fuzz-oracle gates already implied for the decode-only
layers). Opus runs ASan-ONLY: its SILK layer has benign, reference-
inherited signed left-shifts of negative values (libopus's own
silk_LSHIFT pattern; defined on every 2's-complement platform) on a
bit-exact-verified path, so UBSan-strict would flag cosmetic UB without
a real bug — the bit-exact SILK files are left pristine. ctest
decoder_fuzz now covers all three decoders.

# CLI + wrapper feature expansion (SoX-informed) — 2026-07-11

glint has three complete, fuzz-hardened decoders wired to the C ABI +
Python/Rust/Dart wrappers, but the CLI only ENCODES (WAV -> MP3/AAC),
and Opus lives in four side tools. SoX is a DSP toolkit; glint is a
CODEC library, so the goal is a complete codec Swiss-army-knife for its
three formats (encode/decode/transcode/inspect + WAV/raw I/O), NOT DSP
effects. Two buckets:

## Bucket A — codec plumbing (table stakes)
- **A1 CLI decode**: `glint in.{mp3,aac,opus} out.wav` (+ raw). Needs a
  WAV writer; decoders + ABI already exist.
- **A2 Opus in the main CLI**: `in.wav out.opus`, `in.opus out.wav`
  (Ogg mux/demux via OggOpusWriter/Reader); retire the four side tools'
  role for end users.
- **A3 Transcode**: `in.mp3 out.aac` etc. — falls out of decode+encode.
- **A4 stdin/stdout piping** (`-` filename) for Unix pipelines.
- **A5 `--info`**: soxi-style — format, rate, channels, duration,
  bitrate, CBR/VBR. Uses the frame_info parsers.

## Bucket B — codec-adjacent
- **B6 Resampling** (`--rate HZ`): a windowed-sinc/polyphase resampler
  (src/resample.*) so "any WAV -> Opus/native-rate codec" works; also
  reusable in wrappers. The one large item.
- **B7 Gain / peak-normalize** (`--gain dB`, `--norm[=dBFS]`): loudness
  belongs to encoding (clipping/levels); a full effects chain does not.
- **B8 Ogg/Opus container polish**: CLI `.opus` decode honors pre-skip,
  output gain, granule end-trim end to end.

## Out of scope (glint is not SoX)
Effects (reverb/EQ/compand/tempo/pitch), play/rec, foreign-codec read
(FLAC/Vorbis/AIFF). WAV + raw PCM is the I/O boundary.

## Wiring
Every item lands in the CLI AND the three wrappers (decode_file /
transcode_file / resample helpers), each with a unit test (C ABI /
in-process) and a live CLI test (encode->decode/transcode round-trip
vs the existing decoder gates).

## STATUS — DONE (2026-07-11)
Buckets A+B are implemented and wired everywhere.

CLI (cli/main.cpp + cli/audio_io.hpp, one universal float-PCM pipeline):
decode MP3/AAC/Opus -> WAV/raw, encode WAV/raw -> any, transcode, `--info`,
`--rate` resample, `--gain`/`--norm`, stdin/stdout (`-`), Opus unified via
the Ogg mux. Format by extension or header magic. Opus output auto-resamples
to 48 kHz. Live gate `cli_features` (tools/test_cli.py): round-trip SNR
mp3 69 / aac 55 / opus 46 dB, ffmpeg decodes every output.

C ABI (so the wrappers get it all without reimplementing demux/DSP):
- `glint_resample(in, in_frames, ch, sr_in, sr_out, *out_frames)` +
  `glint_free` — Kaiser-windowed sinc (src/resample.*).
- `glint_decode_audio(data, len, *sr, *ch, *frames)` — whole-stream decode,
  auto-detects MP3/AAC/Ogg-Opus from the header, returns malloc'd interleaved
  float (src/decode_audio_c_api.cpp; mirrors the CLI decode path). GOTCHA:
  MP3 0xFFFB vs ADTS 0xFFF share the top nibble — disambiguate with
  `(b1 & 0xF6) == 0xF0` for ADTS (layer bits 00) BEFORE the MP3
  `(b1 & 0xE0) == 0xE0` check, exactly like fmt_from_magic.

Wrappers (each with unit + live tests, all green):
- Python (bindings/python/glint.py): `resample`, `decode_bytes`,
  `decode_file`, `read_wav_float`, `write_wav`, `transcode_file`. Tests in
  test_bindings.py `TestBucketsAB`; ctest `python_bindings`.
- Rust (bindings/rust/glint*): `resample`, `decode_audio` -> `DecodedAudio`;
  FFI in glint-sys, build.rs re-synced (resample.cpp + decode_audio_c_api.cpp).
  Tests `buckets_ab_tests` (cargo test, 5/5).
- Dart (bindings/dart/lib/glint.dart): `glintResample`, `glintDecodeAudio`
  -> `GlintDecodedAudio`. Live test example/buckets_ab.dart.

Opus ENCODE is wired in the wrappers too (2026-07-11): C ABI
`glint_opus_encode_file(pcm48k, frames, ch, bitrate_bps, vbr, *out_size)`
(src/opus_c_api.cpp; CeltEncoder + OggOpusWriter, mirrors the CLI
encode_opus) → Python `encode_opus_file` (+ `.opus` output in
transcode_file, auto-resamples to 48k), Rust `encode_opus_file`, Dart
`glintEncodeOpus`. Input must be 48 kHz float; each wrapper's live test
does 48k sine → encode → decode_audio round-trip. GOTCHA: `cargo clean -p
glint-sys` does NOT force a C recompile of the changed .cpp — a full
`cargo clean` does (cc tracks source mtime on normal incremental builds,
so plain edits are fine; only the partial-clean path is stale).

# Encoder/decoder flexibility pass (2026-07-11) — 4 axes, all paths

Principle: "flexible by default" for handling more inputs correctly (never
opt-in), "optional override" for genuine choices. One implementation in
the C ABI (source of truth), then CLI + Python + Rust + Dart, each gated.

1. **Sample formats** (src/wav_io.*, wav_c_api.cpp): lifted the CLI's full
   WAV parser/writer into shared code and exposed `glint_wav_read` /
   `glint_wav_write` — reads PCM 8/16/24/32, IEEE float 32/64, A-law,
   mu-law, EXTENSIBLE; writes 8/16/24/32-int + 32/64-float. cli/audio_io.hpp
   now DELEGATES (no drift). CLI `--bits`/`--wav-float`. Wrappers:
   read_wav_float/write_wav(bits=,float_fmt=). A 24-bit/float source no
   longer fails in the wrappers. Pipeline is float32 internally, so 64-bit
   float round-trips to ~1e-6.
2. **One-call encode** (encode_audio_c_api.cpp): `glint_encode_audio(pcm,
   frames, ch, sr, format, bitrate, vbr_q, quality, *out_size)` auto-
   resamples to a codec-valid rate (Opus->48k; MP3/AAC->nearest of the
   standard rate set), accepts float, returns the whole stream. Python
   `encode_audio` + `FORMAT_*`, Rust `encode_audio`+`Codec`, Dart
   `glintEncodeAudio`+`GlintCodec`. transcode_file routes through it.
3. **Decoder output** (glint_decode_audio_ex): optional out_rate (resample)
   + want_int16 (int16 vs float) + **Opus surround** (family 1, up to 8 ch
   via OpusMsDecoder). glint_decode_audio delegates to _ex, so surround
   reaches every caller; cli/audio_io.hpp decode_opus does surround too
   (glint_cli 5.1.opus out.wav -> 6ch WAV). Python decode_bytes/decode_file
   rate=/dtype=; Rust decode_audio_rate/decode_audio_i16; Dart
   glintDecodeAudio(rate:)/glintDecodeAudioI16. Live-tested with a real
   ffmpeg-libopus 5.1 file.
4. **Codec knobs**: Python Encoder +quality/vbr_quality; Rust
   Encoder::with_options / AacEncoder::with_options; Dart GlintEncoder
   +mode/quality/path/vbrQuality, GlintAacEncoder +vbrQuality. Opus frame
   size is already the per-call encode() arg; complexity/bandwidth aren't
   in the C API.

BUILD GOTCHA (fixed): cc's own rerun-if-changed proved unreliable across
the target volume — editing a .cpp's *content* silently reused stale
objects (undefined-symbol link errors). glint-sys/build.rs now emits
`cargo:rerun-if-changed` for ../../../src and ../../../include so content
edits trigger a rebuild without a full `cargo clean`.

# Untrusted-input parser audit (2026-07-11)

glint IS an untrusted-input parser (its job is decoding attacker-supplied
compressed audio). The frame/packet decoders (MP3/AAC/Opus) were already
fuzzed under ASan+UBSan (decoder_fuzz). This pass audited the CONTAINER /
whole-file layer the frame fuzzer never reached — the taxonomy from the
CrispASR audit (alloc from an untrusted length field; additive bounds
overflow; degenerate no-progress loops; a family path missing a sibling's
guard).

Findings:
- **WAV reader OOB (src/wav_io.cpp), FIXED**: the WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE
  branch read valid_bits (fmt body+18) and the 16-byte SubFormat GUID
  (body+24..39) after checking only the CLAIMED chunk size `csz >= 40`,
  not that those bytes are present. A truncated file with a `fmt ` chunk
  claiming csz>=40 read up to 24 bytes past the buffer (ASan
  container-overflow, reachable from glint_cli / decode_file / every
  wrapper). Fix: also require `off + 8 + 40 <= n`. The bug was inherited
  from cli/audio_io.hpp's original parse_wav (now deleted — the CLI
  delegates to the fixed shared reader).
- **OggOpusReader::parse (src/opus_ogg.cpp): CLEAN.** Structurally immune
  to the class — `off` is a running cursor always ≤ len (not an
  independent 64-bit offset field), advances ≥27/iteration (forward
  progress), allocs are bounded by file bytes consumed, the hdr[27+255]
  stack buffer exactly fits nsegs≤255, and the family-0/1 header reads are
  all length-guarded (channels>2 / >8 rejected, pending.size() checked
  before every field read).
- decode_audio frame walkers, pcm_read, resample: bounded (running
  cursors / caller-supplied rates, not file-driven).

Durable guard: tools/fuzz_container.cpp (ctest decoder_fuzz, ASan+UBSan)
fuzzes wav_read + OggOpusReader::parse with random + bit-flipped /
truncated / extended seeds. Verified it CATCHES the EXTENSIBLE bug when
reintroduced and passes with the fix. The gate now covers frame decoders
AND container parsers.

# Package publishing — pub.dev + crates.io (2026-08-01)

Handover context: /Users/christianstrobele/code/pupdev.md carries the
pub.dev release rules (clean tree, .pubignore, dry-run with 0 warnings,
verify via the pub.dev API, OIDC + required environment).

## What ships where

| Package | Registry | Version | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `glint_audio` | pub.dev | 0.11.0 | OIDC, tag `glint_audio-v*` |
| `glint_audio_pure` | pub.dev | 0.6.1 | OIDC, tag `glint_audio_pure-v*` |
| `glint-audio` | crates.io | 0.11.0 | Trusted Publishing, tag `rust-v*` |
| `glint-audio-sys` | crates.io | 0.11.0 | Trusted Publishing, tag `rust-v*` |

## Rust crates — renamed and made publishable

- `glint-mp3` -> **`glint-audio`**, `glint-sys` -> **`glint-audio-sys`**.
  The old names predated AAC/Opus/Vorbis/FLAC and undersold the crate;
  nothing had been published, so the names were still free. The `[lib]`
  name stays `glint`, so `use glint::...` is unchanged, and the wrapper
  depends on the -sys crate through a Cargo dependency RENAME
  (`glint_sys = { package = "glint-audio-sys", ... }`) so the ~25
  `glint_sys::` call sites did not have to change.
- **The publish blocker was the source path.** build.rs compiled
  `../../../src/*.cpp`, outside the crate root — `cargo package` only
  archives files under the crate root, so publishing as-is would have
  uploaded a crate that cannot build for anybody. Fix:
  `tools/vendor_rust_sources.sh` copies src/ + include/ into
  `bindings/rust/glint-sys/vendor/` (gitignored, generated), and build.rs
  resolves the repo copy FIRST and the vendored copy only as a fallback,
  so an in-tree build never compiles a stale snapshot.
  - GOTCHA: probe a known translation unit (`src/encoder.cpp`), not the
    directory. This crate has its own Rust `src/`, and cargo's verify step
    unpacks to `target/package/<pkg>-<ver>/`, from where `../../../src`
    can resolve back onto it and look like a hit.
  - GOTCHA: `include = [...]` in Cargo.toml OVERRIDES .gitignore — the
    vendored tree is packaged (verified: 50 .cpp in `cargo package
    --list`) even though git ignores it. That is what keeps the repo
    clean instead of committing a 1.3 MB duplicate of src/.
  - GOTCHA: the flip side of the above — cargo counts packaged-but-
    untracked files as uncommitted changes, so `cargo package` and
    `cargo publish` BOTH need `--allow-dirty` even on a spotless tree.
    Found the hard way: the first real publish aborted with "to proceed
    despite this and include the uncommitted changes, pass the
    `--allow-dirty` flag" listing every vendor/ file. Both the CI job and
    publish-crates.yml pass it. It is safe here precisely because vendor/
    is reproduced from tracked sources immediately beforehand.
  - build.rs now DISCOVERS the .cpp set with read_dir + sort instead of a
    hand-written 50-entry list, so a new source file cannot be vendored
    but left uncompiled. All 50 src/*.cpp were in the old list, so the
    glob is equivalent today.
- Durable guard: the `rust-bindings` CI job runs `cargo test` in-tree and
  then `cargo package` (which verify-BUILDS the packaged crate) after
  vendoring. Without it a new src/*.cpp would pass every existing gate
  and break only the published crate.

## First crates.io release must be manual

crates.io cannot pre-register a trusted publisher for a crate name that
does not exist yet (unlike PyPI's pending publishers): the first version
of each crate has to be published with a token, and only then can Trusted
Publishing be configured. So `rust-v0.11.0` publishes automatically only
from the SECOND release on. Both crates need the trusted publisher added
(repo CrispStrobe/glint, workflow publish-crates.yml, environment
crates.io) after their first manual publish.

## OIDC environment gating (security)

pupdev.md's 2026-07-18 sweep gated 7 repos' publish workflows on a
rule-less `pub.dev` GitHub environment; glint was MISSED because at the
time glint_audio was published manually. It has had OIDC workflows since
2026-07-18 (glint_audio 0.10.0 published through Actions), ungated —
meaning any workflow in the repo with `id-token: write`, or a stray tag
push, could publish. Fixed: `pub.dev` and `crates.io` environments
created rule-less (no reviewer, no branch policy — tag -> publish stays
hands-off) and all three publish workflows reference them.

OWNER ACTION, and only AFTER the workflows above are on main: flip
"Require GitHub Actions environment" on the pub.dev admin page of
glint_audio AND glint_audio_pure. Doing it first makes pub.dev reject the
publish, because the OIDC token would not yet carry the environment claim.

`PUBLISH_PAT` is NOT set on this repo, so autotag-glint_audio.yml skips
by design and release tags are pushed by hand.
