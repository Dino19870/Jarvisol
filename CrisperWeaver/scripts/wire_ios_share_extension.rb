# Create the iOS ShareExtension target in ios/Runner.xcodeproj and wire it
# into the Runner app so `flutter build ios` produces a Runner.app with
# Runner.app/PlugIns/ShareExtension.appex.
#
# The Swift / Info.plist / entitlements source files are checked in at
# ios/ShareExtension/; this script does only the project.pbxproj edits
# that Xcode would otherwise do via the "File → New → Target → Share
# Extension" wizard:
#
#   1. PBXNativeTarget `ShareExtension`, product type app extension
#   2. Sources / Resources / Frameworks build phases
#   3. File refs for ShareViewController.swift + Info.plist + entitlements
#   4. Build configurations (Debug / Release / Profile) mirroring Runner,
#      with PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = <runner-bundle-id>.ShareExtension
#   5. Runner's "Embed App Extensions" CopyFiles phase referencing the
#      extension's product
#
# App Group capability + Code Signing Entitlements are set per-configuration
# via build settings. The shared entitlements file at
# ios/ShareExtension/ShareExtension.entitlements already declares the
# group.com.crispstrobe.crisperweaver group.
#
# Idempotent: re-running detects existing target / file refs and skips.
# After running, do `cd ios && pod install` so receive_sharing_intent's
# pod surfaces in the extension's link list, then build.
#
# Run from repo root: ruby scripts/wire_ios_share_extension.rb
