# crisper_weaver.app bundle so every backend the library was linked
# with is resolvable at runtime. Runs from either the local dev tree
# or CI after `flutter build macos`.

# Per-backend dylibs are NOT copied: every CrispASR backend
# (parakeet / canary / qwen3 / cohere / granite / voxtral / kokoro /
