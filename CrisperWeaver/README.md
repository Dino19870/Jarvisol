# CrisperWeaver

**On-device speech recognition + text-to-speech. No cloud required. 40+ model families, one app.**

CrisperWeaver is a cross-platform Flutter app for fully-offline audio transcription and speech synthesis. Drop in a file, paste a URL, or record with the mic — audio stays on the device. That is the default and the point of the app: every AI feature has an on-device path, nothing phones home, and there are no accounts or telemetry. Three things do use the network, all opt-in and all off until you turn them on: model downloads, cloud transcription, and the BYOK cloud cleanup/summarisation endpoint described below. The [web demo](#platforms) is the exception — the browser has no on-device engine, so it runs against a remote CrispASR Space by design. See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md). 40+ open-weight ASR families and 20+ TTS families are supported through a single unified engine ([CrispASR][crispasr]): Whisper (+ Distil-Whisper), Parakeet (TDT/CTC/RNNT variants + Japanese), Canary, Voxtral, Qwen3-ASR (+ Mega-ASR LoRA), Cohere, Granite (3.x + 4.1 family), FastConformer-CTC, Canary-CTC, Wav2Vec2 / HuBERT / Data2Vec, OmniASR (CTC + LLM + streaming), FireRed, Kyutai-STT, GLM-ASR, Moonshine (+ German variants), VibeVoice ASR, MiMo ASR, Gemma4-E2B (140+ languages), FunASR (+ 31-lang MLT), Paraformer-ZH, SenseVoice (built-in language ID) — plus Kokoro / VibeVoice / Qwen3-TTS (0.6B + 1.7B + VoiceDesign + Gwen-TTS) / Orpheus (+ German variants) / Chatterbox (+ Turbo + Kartoffelbox + Lahgtna Arabic) / IndexTTS / VoxCPM2 / CosyVoice3 / F5-TTS / Bark / CSM / Dia / FastPitch / MeloTTS / OuteTTS / Parler-TTS / Pocket TTS / SpeechT5 / KugelAudio / Piper for synthesis, Pyannote v3 for ML diarisation, FireRedPunc + fullstop-punc + BiLSTM truecaser for punctuation/capitalisation restoration, CLD3 + GlotLID + FastText LID-176 for text language detection, Silero LID for audio language detection, and FireRed/MarbleNet/Whisper-VAD-EncDec VAD options.

## What you can do

- **Transcribe any audio file** — WAV / MP3 / FLAC decoded on-device, no ffmpeg required.
- **Batch-process multiple files** — drop many onto the window or onto the Batch Queue card, "Transcribe all" drains serially; each run lands in History.
- **Record from the mic** and transcribe live.
- **Paste a URL** to a remote file; CrisperWeaver downloads and processes it.
- **Drag and drop** files onto the transcription screen (desktop) or directly on the batch queue.
- **Receive shared audio** from the OS share sheet (Android / iOS / macOS).
- **Choose your model family and quantisation** — q4_0 / q5_0 / q4_k / q5_k / q6_k / q8_0 variants plus f16 originals. Model picker filters by name + backend; Model Management screen auto-probes HuggingFace to discover every available quant.
- **Add from HuggingFace repo** — link-icon button on the Models screen accepts any `OWNER/NAME` HF repo (e.g. `cstr/voxtral-mini-3b-2507-GGUF`), lists the GGUF / .bin files under your chosen backend, and registers them as downloadable models. Mirror of `crispasr --hf-repo` on the CLI side; escape hatch for repos not yet in the baked catalogue.
- **Download and manage models** from a built-in browser — parallel queue, resume, SHA-1 verify, cancel, delete. Companion files (codec / voice / tokenizer GGUFs) auto-download alongside their parent model, including for runtime-discovered HF quants.
- **Advanced decoding knobs** — translate-to-English (Whisper), beam search, initial-prompt vocabulary bias (huge win for domain audio), audio Q&A prompt for instruct-tuned LLM backends (Voxtral / Qwen3), source + target language pickers for true speech translation.
- **Tune the decoder live** — best-of-N slider (1–10, picks the highest-scoring of N decodes; works on every backend) and decoder temperature slider for every backend `crispasr_session_set_temperature` honours (canary, cohere, parakeet, moonshine, voxtral, qwen3, granite, glm-asr, gemma4, omniasr-llm, kyutai-stt).
- **Tune the VAD** — pick between Silero (bundled), FireRedVAD (F1 97.57%), MarbleNet, Whisper-VAD-EncDec; live sliders for threshold, min-speech-ms, min-silence-ms, speech-pad-ms.
- **Pick the diarisation method** — vad-turns (default, mono-friendly), pyannote (ML, GGUF), stereo energy, stereo cross-correlation.
- **Pick the language-detection method** — Whisper-encoder LID (reuses an existing model) or Silero 95-langs (faster + smaller).
- **See live performance numbers** — real-time factor, words per second, wall-clock.
- **Get word-level timestamps** and language auto-detection (via Whisper).
- **Stream transcription** from long-running mic input — partial transcripts appear in the output card while you talk (10 s sliding window / 3 s step).
- **Watch long files transcribe in real time** — chunked Whisper splits >60 s files into 30 s windows and streams segments through as each finishes, instead of waiting until the end.
- **Export** to `.txt`, `.srt`, `.vtt`, `.json`, `.csv`, `.lrc` (lyrics), or `.wts` (Whisper Text Segments debug) through the system share sheet.
- **Review history** — every run is persisted as JSON and browseable / re-exportable, with speaker renames preserved across launches.
- **Rename diariser speakers** — tap a speaker chip in the output to override the auto-assigned label ("Speaker 1" → "Alice"); the new name persists in history.
- **See where storage went** — Settings → Storage breakdown lists per-backend disk usage with a one-click "delete all of X" action.
- **Diagnose with logs** — in-app viewer with filter / search / copy / export, optional file sink.
- **Synthesize speech (TTS)** — pick a downloaded TTS model + voice + codec on the *Synthesize* screen, type text, hit *Synthesize*; output plays in-app and saves as WAV. Advanced section adds trim-silence, 0.25×–4× speed slider, reference-transcript field for runtime voice cloning, and natural-language voice-design prompts (qwen3-tts VoiceDesign).
- **Translate text** — dedicated *Translate* screen wired to CrispASR's `crispasr_session_translate_text`. Pick from M2M-100 (100 langs, any-to-any), WMT21 Dense (en↔X, two separate checkpoints), or MADLAD-400 (419 langs); source/target language dropdowns with one-click swap, max-tokens slider, copy-to-clipboard.
- **Bake your own voice** — *Bake voice* screen drives CrispASR's `bake-chatterbox-voice-from-wav.py` via `Process.start`: pick a WAV reference, set the output filename, hit *Bake*. Stdout + stderr stream into a live tail panel + the in-app Log viewer; the resulting GGUF is dropped straight into the models directory so it shows up in the voicepack picker on the next open. Desktop-only — mobile has no Python runtime. Available from the cake icon in the *Synthesize* app-bar.
- **Restore punctuation** — FireRedPunc (ZH+EN) or fullstop-punc (EN/DE/FR/IT) toggle in Advanced Options; turns `wav2vec2 / fastconformer-ctc / firered-asr` lowercase output into properly punctuated text. Picker chooses which family runs when both are downloaded.
- **Use CrisperWeaver in English or German** — full i18n scaffold via `flutter_localizations`, 866 keys per locale covering every user-facing string (guarded by an ARB-consistency test).
- **Capture system audio** — "Transcribe what's playing in Zoom / YouTube / any app." ScreenCaptureKit on macOS 13+, `parec` on Linux, ffmpeg-WASAPI loopback on Windows, MediaProjection on Android 10+; iOS deliberately unsupported (Apple's sandbox forbids it).
- **Boost custom vocabulary** — chip list in Advanced Options; routed per-backend-class via `initial_prompt` (whisper / moonshine), `setAsk` prefix (audio-LLM backends), or no-op (CTC-style with explanatory helper text).
- **Edit any segment inline** — long-press → edit dialog. Edits update both AppState AND the on-disk history JSON so they survive a reload. Edited segments get a pencil-icon marker.
- **Search history** — substring filter on title + transcript with yellow-highlighted matches; auto-expand of matching entries.
- **Edit audio with waveform sync** — dedicated audio editor screen with trim / cut middle / split into chapters + an optional collapsible transcript pane on the same screen. Tap a segment → playhead jumps. Long-press a segment → Select / Trim to / Mark for split. Tap the waveform → matching segment highlights. Pure-Dart, no FFmpeg, identical on every platform.
- **Tidy any transcript** — pure-Dart deterministic pass (filler removal, repeat collapsing, sentence-case, punctuation fix, optional annotation strip) with a before/after preview of the first three segments. Optional opt-in LLM pass on top via a three-mode selector: **Off** (deterministic only), **Cloud** (bring your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint — OpenAI / Anthropic via proxy / OpenRouter / Groq / Cerebras / Together / local llama-server; key stays on device), or **Local** (point at a GGUF chat model on disk and run it on-device via Metal / CUDA / CPU through libcrispasr's chat ABI — no network, no API key, model stays warm across passes).
- **Summarise meetings** — Action Items / Key Topics / Decisions as structured Markdown, via either the cloud BYOK endpoint or the on-device chat model — same three-mode chooser as the cleanup pass.
- **Save presets** — bundle `(backend, modelId, language, AdvancedOptions)` into a named preset. One tap restores all four atomically. JSON-backed with schema-versioned migration so a stale preset on a newer build doesn't crash.
- **Push-to-transcribe from anywhere** — desktop-only system hotkey (macOS / Linux / Windows). Push-to-talk OR toggle behaviour; combo parser handles modifier aliases (cmd / command / win / super → meta, ctrl → control, option → alt).
- **Clone a voice in three steps** — guided wizard launched from the *Synthesize* screen: record 10 s OR pick a WAV → type the reference transcript → hand off to *Synthesize* with everything pre-populated. Runs on top of the existing chatterbox / indextts / qwen3-tts-base / vibevoice runtime-cloning surface.
- **Whisper subtitle formatting** — tokens-per-segment cap + split-on-word toggle in Advanced Options. Produces SRT-friendly short subtitle lines instead of long-paragraph segments. **Split-on-punct** additionally breaks at sentence-ending punctuation (. ! ?) — works with any backend, not just whisper.
- **Semantic transcript search** — search your history by meaning, not just keywords. When a small embedding model is downloaded (~23 MB), History search uses real vector embeddings (cosine similarity) instead of substring matching. Persisted embeddings avoid re-encoding. Cross-modal audio embeddings supported with larger models.
- **Subtitle overlay / teleprompter** — fullscreen always-on-top transparent overlay showing live streaming transcription as subtitles. Font size, position, and background controls. On macOS the window floats above other apps via platform channel.
- **Compare transcripts side by side** — re-transcribe the same audio with two models in parallel (two single-worker pools via `Future.wait`) and see a word-level diff with Jaccard similarity stats. Helps pick the best model for your domain.
- **Tag transcript segments** — annotate segments with bookmark, action-item, question, important, highlight, decision, or follow-up tags. Tags persist in history and render as emoji badges.
- **Keyboard-navigate transcripts** — J/K to jump segments, Space to play/pause, Enter to edit, Tab to jump to next low-confidence word. Desktop power-user feature.
- **Export to note-taking tools** — Obsidian (YAML frontmatter + timestamped bullets), Notion (speaker headers), Logseq (indented blocks), YouTube chapters (HH:MM:SS lines).
- **Watch a folder for new audio** — point CrisperWeaver at a directory and new audio files are auto-transcribed. Duplicate files are auto-skipped via audio fingerprinting. Desktop-only; configurable in Settings.
- **TTS pronunciation lexicon** — user-editable word-to-pronunciation override table for proper nouns, acronyms, and domain terms. Applied before TTS synthesis.
- **Detect chapters automatically** — topic-shift detection via vocabulary analysis, exportable as YouTube chapters or Podcasting 2.0 JSON.
- **Confidence heatmap** — toggle in the transcript output menu to color-code words by decoder confidence (background gradient: green → yellow → orange → red).
- **Synthetic content compliance** — every TTS-generated WAV is watermarked (native CrispASR spread-spectrum, upgradeable to AudioSeal neural watermark via GGUF; pure-Dart LSB fallback on older dylibs) and carries LIST INFO provenance metadata identifying it as AI-generated. MP3 exports carry ID3v2.3 TXXX frames for AI provenance (`AI_GENERATED`, `GENERATOR`, `AI_CONTENT_NOTICE`). Voice-cloned TTS output is prepended with a 3-beep 880 Hz audio disclaimer (EU AI Act Art. 50(4)). Post-embed watermark verification detects the watermark immediately after embedding and warns if absent. Consent attestation audit logging (`[CONSENT] ts=… model=… voice=… attestation="user consent"`) records every voice-cloned synthesis in the same format used by CrispASR and CrispTTS. Speaker enrollment requires explicit biometric consent (GDPR Art. 9); consent records are persisted and deleted alongside speaker profiles. Exports support an optional machine-readable disclosure notice. Audio-Q&A answers and machine translations are flagged on the segments themselves and persisted with the history entry, so a re-export months later still says what the text actually is instead of calling it a transcript. See *About → Synthetic Content Compliance* in the app.

## Supported models

One dispatcher (`CrispasrSession`) handles every backend; bundled `libcrispasr` reports at startup which are linked in the current build, and the *Models* screen filter chips group them by kind (`ASR / TTS / Voices / Codecs / Post-processors`). The Model Management screen also probes CrispASR's built-in C-side registry on every open, so any backend the bundled libcrispasr knows about appears even if it isn't hardcoded in the app catalog.

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.38.x (`stable`)
- Xcode + CocoaPods for iOS / macOS
- JDK 17 + Android SDK for Android
- CMake + a C++ toolchain to build `libwhisper` from CrispASR
- Optional: Metal (macOS), CUDA / Vulkan (Linux/Windows), Core ML (iOS), NNAPI (Android)

### Clone the repos side-by-side

```bash
mkdir crisperweaver && cd crisperweaver
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispASR.git
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrispEmbed.git
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrisperWeaver.git
```

`pubspec.yaml` refers to the Dart FFI packages via `path: ../CrispASR/flutter/crispasr`
and `path: ../CrispEmbed/flutter/crispembed`.

### Desktop one-shot (recommended)

Each desktop platform has an end-to-end script that configures + builds CrispASR's `libwhisper` / `whisper.dll`, runs `flutter build`, and bundles every needed dynamic library next to the runner. They expect the sibling `CrispASR` checkout described above.

```bash
# macOS
./scripts/build_macos.sh release

# Linux
./scripts/build_linux.sh release

# Windows (cmd.exe — picks up pwsh if installed, falls back to powershell.exe)
build_windows.bat release
# or directly:
pwsh -File scripts\build_windows.ps1 release
```

Pass `debug` instead of `release` for a debug build; add `--rebuild-cmake` (or `-RebuildCmake` on Windows) to force a fresh CrispASR cmake configure. Each script's output ends with a path to the runnable bundle / `.app` / `.exe`.

The bundlers can also be invoked standalone (`scripts/bundle_macos_dylibs.sh`, `scripts/bundle_linux_libs.sh`, `scripts/bundle_windows_dlls.ps1`) if you've already built CrispASR and `flutter build <platform>` separately and just want to drop the libs in place.

At runtime, `CrispASREngine` resolves the library by probing platform-specific names — `crispasr.dll` / `libcrispasr.dylib` / `libcrispasr.so` first, then the `whisper`-named alias — under the bundle, the user's CrispASR checkout, system lib dirs, and any user-supplied override path.

### Manual / iterative dev

```bash
cd CrispASR
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DWHISPER_METAL=ON
cmake --build build --parallel --target crispasr

cd ../CrisperWeaver
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos        # or: linux, windows, android, ios
```

`flutter run` picks up the freshly-built CrispASR shared library directly from `../CrispASR/build/src/` for fast inner-loop work.

---

## Using it

1. **First run**: open *Settings → Manage models* and download the model you want. Default pick is Whisper base (~140 MB, covers 99 languages).
2. **Transcribe a file**: back to the main screen, drop a file or click the picker. Language auto-detects by default.
3. **Record from the mic**: use the recorder card. Stop → transcribe.
4. **Stream from mic** (Whisper): toggle *Stream* in the recorder. Partial text arrives as you speak.
5. **Synthesize speech** (TTS): tap the *Synthesize* icon in the app-bar (next to *Models*). Pick a downloaded TTS model + voice + codec, type text, hit *Synthesize* — output plays in-app and can be saved as WAV via the share sheet.
6. **Export the result**: share-sheet button → pick TXT / SRT / VTT / JSON.
7. **Browse past runs**: *History* in the drawer — everything is persisted as JSON under `<app-docs>/history/`.

Useful Settings:
- **Preferred engine** — CrispASR is the default.
- **Default model / language** — pre-select across new transcriptions.
- **Custom models directory** — point CrisperWeaver at an existing GGUF
  library on an external disk (the *Models directory* picker), e.g.
  `/Volumes/backups/ai/crispasr`, to reuse already-downloaded models
  instead of re-fetching into the app sandbox. Cross-platform; the model
  picker reads flat GGUFs from that folder and "Use default" restores the
  sandbox `<app-docs>/models/whisper_cpp` location. (On Android 11+ an
  external/shared-storage path needs the one-time "All files access" grant.)
- **Skip checksum verification** — custom / mirrored GGUFs.
- **Log level + file sink** — `<app-docs>/logs/session.log` for bug reports.

---

## Testing

The default test pass is fast and offline:

```bash
flutter analyze    # 0 issues — see analysis_options.yaml for the strict rule set
flutter test       # 378 tests, ~20 s — widget unit + service / persistence / batch / dispatch
```

`test/backend_dispatch_test.dart` always runs the cheap dispatch
checks (every backend appears in `CrispasrSession.availableBackends()`,
opens with bogus paths fail cleanly). The expensive end-to-end synth /
transcribe roundtrips are tagged `slow` and skip themselves silently
unless their `CRISPASR_TEST_<BACKEND>_MODEL` env var points at a
downloaded GGUF. Opt in with:

```bash
M=/path/to/crispasr-models
CRISPASR_TEST_KOKORO_MODEL=$M/kokoro-82m-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_KOKORO_VOICE=$M/kokoro-voice-af_heart.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_QWEN3_TTS_MODEL=$M/qwen3-tts-12hz-0.6b-customvoice-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_QWEN3_TTS_CODEC=$M/qwen3-tts-tokenizer-12hz.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_VIBEVOICE_MODEL=$M/vibevoice-realtime-0.5b-tts-f32-tokenizer.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_VIBEVOICE_VOICE=$M/vibevoice-voice-en-Emma_woman.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_ORPHEUS_MODEL=$M/orpheus-3b-base-q8_0.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_ORPHEUS_CODEC=$M/snac-24khz.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_MIMO_ASR_MODEL=$M/mimo/mimo-asr-q4_k.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_MIMO_ASR_TOKENIZER=$M/mimo/mimo-tokenizer-q4_k.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_COSYVOICE3_MODEL=$M/cosyvoice3-llm-q4_k.gguf \
CRISPASR_TEST_WHISPER_MODEL=$M/ggml-tiny.bin \
flutter test --tags slow test/backend_dispatch_test.dart
```

The cosyvoice3 roundtrip needs its `flow` / `hift` / `voices` companions
sitting beside the LLM GGUF (auto-discovered by filename). There is also
an `f5-tts` roundtrip (`CRISPASR_TEST_F5TTS_MODEL=$M/f5-tts-v1-base-f16.gguf`,
zero-shot clone from `test/jfk.wav`) — left out of the line above on
purpose: its DiT synth is *extremely* slow (~50 min for one short sentence
on M1 Metal), so opt into it only deliberately and on its own.

A single sweep takes ~25 min on M1 Metal end-to-end (full sweep —
6 backends including a 3 B Llama and a 4 GB f32 vibevoice). Each
backend skips if its env var isn't set, so partial sweeps are cheap.
Coverage:

```bash
flutter test --coverage      # writes coverage/lcov.info
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html  # if lcov is installed
```

See `dart_test.yaml` for the tag config and `PLAN.md §5.18` for the
test-suite speed roadmap (the architectural win is a persistent
ggml-metal pipeline cache via `MTLBinaryArchive`, which would cut
the cold-start kernel-JIT cost from minutes to seconds).

---

## CI & releases

- **`ci.yml`** — on push / PR: `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` on Ubuntu and macOS, plus debug `.app` and Linux bundle uploaded as workflow artifacts. Checks out sibling `CrispStrobe/CrispASR` automatically. Slow tests (`--tags slow`) are skipped by default; CI can opt in by setting the `CRISPASR_TEST_*` env vars and adding `--tags slow` to the test command. Analyzer is configured to **error** on `use_build_context_synchronously`, `avoid_print`, `unused_*`, `inference_failure_*`, and `deprecated_member_use` — a regression fails the build instead of silently piling up.
- **`release.yml`** — on a `vX.Y.Z` tag (or manual dispatch): builds and uploads
    - `crisper_weaver-macos.zip` — Metal-enabled `.app`, ad-hoc signed, all 24+ backend dylibs (kokoro / orpheus / mimo-asr included as of CrispASR `ba7d6ed`) bundled.
    - `crisper_weaver-linux-x64.tar.gz` — GTK-3 desktop bundle with all backend `.so`'s.
    - `crisper_weaver-windows-x64.zip` — portable zip with `runner.exe` + `whisper.dll` + sibling backend DLLs.
    - `crisper_weaver-windows-x64.msix` — installable MSIX that registers "Open With → CrisperWeaver" for audio + subtitle types in Explorer. Unsigned for now (see Windows install below).
    - `crisper_weaver-android-arm64.apk` — real ASR. CrispASR cross-built via `build-android.sh --abi arm64-v8a`; `libwhisper.so` and sibling backend `.so`'s dropped into `jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`.
    - `crisper_weaver-ios-unsigned.ipa` — sideload-compatible (see below).

Both workflows honour `CRISPASR_REPO` / `CRISPASR_REF` env vars at the top of each file, in case you maintain a fork of CrispASR.

### Sideloading iOS

We don't pay for the Apple Developer Program yet, so the iOS IPA in releases is **unsigned**. To install it on your own device, use a sideload service:

- **[SideStore](https://sidestore.io/)** — iOS app installer that uses your own Apple ID for signing (free: 7-day re-sign; paid ADP: 1-year). Self-hosted via StosVPN or pair-with-computer.
- **[AltStore](https://altstore.io/)** — the original self-sign flow; requires a desktop-side companion (AltServer).
- **[Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather)** — open-source alternative.

All three accept the `.ipa` directly: download `crisper_weaver-ios-unsigned.ipa` from the release page, open in SideStore (Files → share to SideStore), tap Install. The free-tier 7-day limit means you'll need to re-sign weekly unless you also have a paid Apple Developer account.

### Installing on Windows

Two artefacts ship per release; pick one:

- **`crisper_weaver-windows-x64.zip`** — portable. Unzip anywhere, run `crisper_weaver.exe`. No installer, no file associations, doesn't survive across machines cleanly. Good for quick trials and tech users.
- **`crisper_weaver-windows-x64.msix`** — installable. Lands in `Apps & features`, uninstalls cleanly, and **registers "Open With → CrisperWeaver" in Explorer** for `.wav` / `.mp3` / `.m4a` / `.flac` / `.ogg` / `.aac` / `.opus` / `.wma` / `.srt` / `.vtt`. Recommended for everyday use.

The MSIX is **not signed by a Microsoft Store-trusted CA yet** (Microsoft Store registration is on the roadmap), so the first install needs a one-time trust step:

1. Download `crisper_weaver-windows-x64.msix` from the release page.
2. Right-click → Properties → tick **Unblock** (under the General tab, bottom right).
3. Double-click the `.msix` → **Install**. Windows Security may warn ("Untrusted publisher") — accept once.
4. After install, right-click any audio file in Explorer → **Open With → CrisperWeaver**.

Once we publish to Microsoft Store, that warning goes away — `winget install CrisperWeaver` and the Store listing will both ship the same MSIX, signed.

---

## Roadmap

The short version:

- CoreML acceleration for Whisper on iOS/macOS (enable `WHISPER_USE_COREML` inside CrispASR, ship the paired `.mlmodelc` next to the `.bin`).
- Swap the MFCC/k-means diarization stopgap for the shared-lib `crispasr_diarize_segments_abi` introduced in CrispASR v0.4.5 (pyannote GGUF + energy/xcorr/vad-turns in one call).
- Wire the shared `crispasr_detect_language_pcm` (v0.4.6) for auto-language on backends that lack native LID.
- Wire `crispasr_align_words_abi` (v0.4.7) to give word-level timestamps to LLM-based backends (qwen3 / voxtral / granite) that don't emit them natively.
- Expose more CrispASR power-user knobs in the UI: beam search / best-of-N, temperature, source/target languages for translation backends, audio Q&A mode, streaming UI (see PLAN.md §5.8). VAD and `initialPrompt` already shipped in v0.1.7.
- Windows CI job (build script + DLL bundler shipped — `scripts/build_windows.ps1`; CI workflow still TODO).
- Android CI: cross-build `libwhisper.so` + sibling backends, drop into `jniLibs/`, ship a real-ASR APK.
- iOS `pod install` + device-build CI verification.
- Finish i18n migration for widgets + older Settings strings.
- Backend-specific UX (source/target language UI for Canary, Voxtral audio Q&A mode, Granite `--ask` flag, etc.).

## Acceptable use & compliance

CrisperWeaver can clone voices and identify speakers. Because everything runs on your device, there is no server-side moderation — and under the EU AI Act you are the **deployer** of these AI systems, so the disclosure duties are yours.

- [`ACCEPTABLE_USE.md`](ACCEPTABLE_USE.md) — what voice cloning and speaker ID may be used for, the consent rules, and how to report misuse.
- [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) — what is stored on device (including biometric voice embeddings) and your rights over it.
- [`docs/AI_ACT_RISK.md`](docs/AI_ACT_RISK.md) · [`docs/DPIA.md`](docs/DPIA.md) · [`docs/AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md`](docs/AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md) — risk classification, data-protection impact assessment, Annex IV technical documentation.

Every file the app synthesises is watermarked, C2PA-signed and metadata-tagged automatically; cloned and voice-converted output additionally carries an audible beep disclaimer. Two limits worth knowing: container metadata is stripped by re-encoding (the watermark survives), and audio under ~100 ms or digitally silent cannot carry a watermark at all — the app tells you when that happens rather than claiming a mark it did not make.

**Received audio you believe impersonates someone?** [Report it here](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/CrisperWeaver/issues/new?labels=abuse-report&template=abuse-report.md). That address is embedded in the provenance manifest of every generated file, so it travels with the audio.
