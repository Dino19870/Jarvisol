// EU AI Act compliance tripwires — an allow-list over the call sites where
// the app's compliance controls have to be applied.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// Six compliance audits have each found at least one live defect, and every
// one of them had the same shape: a control implemented at the place a
// feature was designed, and a *second route* to the same capability that
// skipped it.
//
//   1. GUI marked generated audio; the CLI wrote bare WAVs.
//   2. The app marked generated text; the edit path re-encoded it away.
//   3. /v1/translations disclosed; /v1/audio/transcriptions did not.
//   4. Everything marked at production; `HistoryEntry.toJson` dropped it on save.
//   5. `CrispasrEngine` stripped emotion tags; `HfSpaceEngine` did not.
//   6. `CrispasrEngine` held all three controls; `TranscriptionWorkerPool`
//      — a second entry to the same native sessions — held none, and the
//      Copy/Share exits held none either.
//
// Each was fixed at the missing site, and each fix came with a test asserting
// *that site* was covered. None of those tests could see the next one. The
// round-6 test is the sharpest example: it asserted every **engine** parsing
// model text calls `EmotionInference.strip`, passed throughout, and a worker
// pool is not an engine.
//
// So this file does not test behaviour. It enumerates every call site in
// `lib/` that touches a compliance boundary and compares it against a
// reviewed list. A new site fails CI with a note saying what to check. The
// question stops being "did anyone remember?" and becomes a build break.
//
// WHEN THIS TEST FAILS
//
// It is not telling you the code is wrong. It is telling you that a call site
// appeared or moved at a boundary where six audits found defects, and that
// someone should spend thirty seconds deciding which of these is true:
//
//   • the new site is correctly routed through the control → update the count
//     here, in the same commit;
//   • the new site bypasses the control → route it, then update the count.
//
// Do not "fix" a failure by deleting the entry. Counting is deliberately
// brittle: brittleness is the mechanism, and the cost of a look is seconds.
