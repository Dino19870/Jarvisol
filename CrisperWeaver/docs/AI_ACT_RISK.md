# EU AI Act Risk Classification — CrisperWeaver

**Date:** 2026-08-02 (revised; originally 2026-07-16)
**Regulation:** Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act)
**Application:** CrisperWeaver v0.9.9+

---

## 1. System Overview

CrisperWeaver is a cross-platform application for on-device audio
transcription, speech synthesis, speaker identification, document
analysis, LLM-backed text processing, and semantic search.

**Data flow, stated precisely.** Every AI subsystem runs locally on the
user's device by default, and the app has no backend of its own. Two
features are exceptions once the user enables them, and both are off
until they do:

- **Cloud transcription** (§2.1) — audio to a CrispASR HuggingFace Space.
- **Cloud text processing** (§2.7) — transcript text to a user-configured
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Earlier revisions of this document asserted flatly that "no data is
transmitted to external servers". That was inaccurate for those two paths
and is corrected here; the app's first-use notice and `PRIVACY.md` §3.3
have been corrected to match. Biometric data — speaker embeddings, voice
profiles — is transmitted under **no** configuration.

## 2. AI Subsystems and Risk Classification

### 2.1 Speech Recognition (ASR)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Converts audio to text |
| Annex III category | Not listed |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** |
| Rationale | General-purpose transcription does not fall under any Annex III category. Not used for law enforcement, border control, employment, or critical infrastructure. |

### 2.2 Speech Synthesis (TTS)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Generates spoken audio from text |
| Annex III category | Not listed directly |
| Art. 50(4) applicability | **Yes** — generates synthetic audio that could constitute a "deep fake" |
| Risk level | **Subject to Art. 50 transparency obligations** |
| Mitigations | Spread-spectrum watermark (auto-embedded), C2PA COSE-signed provenance manifest, beep disclaimer on voice-cloned output, AI_GENERATED ID3v2/LIST INFO metadata, consent gate for voice cloning |

### 2.3 Voice Cloning (TTS with reference voice)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Generates speech replicating a specific person's voice |
| Art. 50(4) applicability | **Yes** — deep fake audio |
| GDPR Art. 9 applicability | **Yes** — processes biometric characteristics |
| Risk level | **Subject to Art. 50 + GDPR Art. 9** |
| Mitigations | Mandatory consent attestation, beep disclaimer (mandatory, override requires legal attestation), watermark + C2PA signing, consent audit logging |

### 2.4 Speaker Identification

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Confirms a **claimed** participant against a closed, consent-derived roster of enrolled profiles using TitaNet neural embeddings |
| Annex III category | **Outside 1(a)** — biometric *verification*, which 1(a) expressly excludes |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** (fallback argument under Art. 6(3) if that reading is rejected) |
| Rationale | See §3 below |
| Mitigations | Closed-roster API (`expectedNames` + `consentAttested`, throws without consent), explicit GDPR Art. 9(2)(a) consent gate on every enrolment path, roster derived from consent records so withdrawal removes the speaker from matching, on-device-only processing, right to erasure, data portability |

### 2.5 Document Analysis (OCR)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Recognizes text in images using neural OCR engines |
| Annex III category | Not listed |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** |
| Rationale | General-purpose text recognition, not used for surveillance, law enforcement, or access control |

### 2.6 Semantic Search

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Dense vector similarity search over transcription history |
| Annex III category | Not listed |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** |
| Rationale | Local search over user's own data, no profiling or scoring of natural persons |

### 2.7 Text Generation (LLM) — translation, summarisation, cleanup

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Translates text, summarises transcripts into action items / topics / decisions, and cleans up transcripts. Runs against an on-device GGUF model, or — opt-in and off by default — a user-configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| Annex III category | Not listed |
| Art. 50(2) applicability | **Yes for translation and summarisation** — these generate or substantially restate content |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk; subject to Art. 50(2) transparency** |
| Mitigations | Disclosure attached on screen and on copy/export; `x-content-ai-generated` header plus a `_disclosure` field on the HTTP translation endpoint |

Three points this subsystem raises that the others do not:

- **It is the only subsystem whose data can leave the device.** The cloud
  mode sends transcript text — which routinely contains personal data
  about people other than the user — to a third party the user chooses.
  The app cannot make privacy commitments on that provider's behalf and
  does not try to; it discloses the flow (`PRIVACY.md` §3.3, first-use
  notice) and defaults to the local model.
- **Cleanup is deliberately excluded from the marking duty, and the
  exclusion is enforced in the prompt rather than merely asserted.**
  Art. 50(2) carves out systems performing "an assistive function for
  standard editing" that do not substantially alter the input data or its
  semantics. The deterministic pass — filler removal, sentence casing,
  punctuation repair, whitespace normalisation — is plainly within that.
  The optional LLM pass is held to the same standard by its system prompt
  (`cloud_llm_cleanup_service.dart`), which instructs the model to
  *"preserve the speaker's words, meaning, and language"*, to *"never
  paraphrase, expand, or summarise"* and to *"never add information not
  present in the input"*. Should that prompt ever be loosened toward
  rewriting, the carve-out stops applying and the output needs marking —
  so the prompt is a compliance boundary, not a quality setting. LLM
  summarisation and translation are outside the carve-out and are marked.
- **Text has no container.** Audio carries three independent marks
  (watermark, C2PA manifest, container metadata); text can carry only the
  disclosure itself, which a recipient can trivially delete. That is a
  limitation of the medium rather than of the implementation, and is why
  the disclosure is attached at every point where text leaves the app
  rather than only where it is displayed.

### 2.8 Emotion Recognition — **removed** (2026-08-02)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | **None.** The app performs no emotion recognition |
| Annex III category | Would have been **1(c)**; not engaged, because the feature no longer exists |
| Art. 50(3) applicability | **No** — nothing to disclose |
| Risk level | **Out of scope** |
| Enforcement | `EmotionInference` in `lib/utils/emotion_inference.dart` is an **allow-list** (since 2026-08-03) plus the `strip` filter that applies it: only the seven known acoustic-event labels survive, so an affective tag nobody has enumerated — a new backend, a new SenseVoice release — is discarded rather than published. It is applied at **every parse boundary**: `CrispasrEngine._mapSessionSegments`, `HfSpaceEngine` (both routes, added 2026-08-02), and `workerSegmentFromMap` — the worker pool's boundary, added 2026-08-03 after the audit found it rebuilding every pooled segment untouched. The CLI drops the tags on every output format. Pinned by `test/synthetic_compliance_test.dart` |

**What was there, and why it went.** SenseVoice backends emit inline
`<\|HAPPY\|>` / `<\|SAD\|>` / `<\|ANGRY\|>` / `<\|SURPRISED\|>` /
`<\|FEARFUL\|>` / `<\|DISGUSTED\|>` / `<\|NEUTRAL\|>` tags alongside the
transcript. The engine parsed them into `metadata['emotion']` and the
transcript widget rendered a per-segment badge. That is inferring the
emotional state of a natural person from biometric data — an emotion
recognition system under Art. 3(39), listed at Annex III **1(c)**.

**This subsystem was undeclared until the audit of 2026-08-02.** §3.3 of
this document read "No emotion recognition and no biometric categorisation
is performed" and concluded Art. 50(3) was not engaged. That was true of
the Chatterbox `[angry]` / `[whispering]` tags on the *generation* side —
which is all the earlier analysis looked at — and false of the SenseVoice
*recognition* side, which had been shipping since the backend was
catalogued. The error is recorded rather than quietly corrected because
two previous audits both re-read §3.3 and both missed it: the claim was
being checked against the synthesis screen and never against the ASR
engine.

**Why removal rather than compliance.** Art. 50(3) transparency was the
cheap part and was in fact implemented first. The expensive part is
Annex III 1(c), which has no verification-style carve-out to fall outside
of: from 2 Dec 2027 it brings risk management, logging, human oversight and
conformity assessment, plus Art. 49(2) EU-database registration if the
Art. 6(3) derogation were relied on — and the derogation argument was weak
here, because the app parsed the tags deliberately, classified them with a
dedicated helper, and rendered a labelled badge, which reads as intent.

Set against that: the badge was display-only. It never reached an export, a
share payload, or a history record. Art. 5(1)(f) compounded the imbalance —
inferring emotions in workplaces and schools is prohibited outright, the
app cannot detect deployment context, and a policy line was the only
control available for a feature that shipped enabled.

A permanent high-risk obligation for a per-segment badge that nothing
persisted was not a trade worth making, so the feature was deleted.

**What is *not* removed.** SenseVoice remains a fully supported
transcription backend. Its acoustic *event* tags (`SPEECH`, `BGM`,
`LAUGHTER`, `APPLAUSE`, …) are still parsed and badged: classifying
laughter as an audio event describes the recording, not the speaker's inner
state, and is not an inference about a natural person.

**Re-opens if** any model's output is surfaced as an emotional, affective,
or intent-bearing attribute of a speaker — including via a new backend, a
plugin, or an LLM prompt that asks for tone or mood.

**The "only works for tags it names" caveat no longer applies to this
control** (2026-08-03). It was written when `strip` was a *deny*-list:
it dropped the eight labels enumerated here and **kept everything else**, so
a backend emitting `<|STRESSED|>` or `<|CONFIDENT|>` would have passed an
affective inference straight into `metadata['sensevoice_tags']`, history and
the JSON export, without a line of this app changing. "No emotion
recognition" held only for as long as the list stayed ahead of the models —
which is not a property anyone can maintain.

`strip` now keeps **only** the seven known acoustic events and discards
everything else, so an unrecognised tag fails closed. Behaviour is identical
for every tag that exists today; the difference is entirely in what happens
to one that does not. `test/compliance_boundaries_test.dart` asserts the
polarity, because reverting it would be a one-character change with no
visible symptom.

The caveat still stands for `AffectivePromptGuard` (§2.9), which screens free
text and has no closed vocabulary to allow-list against. That asymmetry is
the point: where a closed vocabulary exists, fail closed; where it does not,
say so plainly rather than implying the same strength.

**And a third time, four hours later, while building the fix for the
second.** Enumerating every call site in order to wrap the CrispASR session
turned up **four more** unfiltered constructions, all inside
`CrispasrEngine` — the file every audit had treated as the one place that
got this right:

- the **streamed-segment drain** (`crispasr.drainStreamedSegments()`), which
  pushes interim segments to the live transcript view during an ordinary
  transcription — so emotion tags were visible in the UI until the final
  mapped segments replaced them;
- `_mapWhisperSegments`, benign in practice (whisper emits no such tags) but
  a model-text parse site with no filter;
- both halves of the streaming controller, `session.feed()` and
  `session.flush()`.

The first of those is why the planned fix changed shape. A wrapper around
`CrispasrSession` — the obvious structural answer, and the one recorded at
§5.2 as outstanding — **would not have caught it**, because it reads from a
free function rather than from the session object. Any control placed on a
*source* has the same defect: it is only as complete as the enumeration of
sources, and six audits had now got that enumeration wrong six times.

So the filter moved to the **destination type**.
`TranscriptionSegment.fromModelText` is the only supported way to build a
segment from model output; it strips, records the surviving acoustic events,
and cannot be skipped by a route nobody thought of, because every route ends
at a `TranscriptionSegment`. The question "which parse boundaries are there?"
stops being one anyone has to answer correctly.

**And it fired a second time, on 2026-08-03, in the plainest way available:
a second parse boundary that had never applied the filter at all.**

Segments do not always come back from `CrispasrEngine._mapSessionSegments`.
When the **worker pool** is in use — the default for batch jobs, and the
path `CrispasrEngine` itself takes whenever a pool is loaded — each segment
crosses an isolate boundary as a plain map and is rebuilt on the main side
by `workerSegmentFromMap`. That function copied `text` straight through.
A SenseVoice `<|ANGRY|>` therefore reached the transcript, the UI, history
and every export on the pooled route, which is to say: the capability this
section says was deleted was still running, live, on a reachable path.

This is worse than the `HfSpaceEngine` gap the fifth audit found, and the
comparison is the point. That one was **latent** — no SenseVoice backend is
offered on the cloud route, so nothing could exercise it. This one has no
such protection: SenseVoice is a catalogued local backend and the pool is
the default execution mode for batch.

**Why the fifth audit's own test did not catch it.** That audit moved the
filter to `EmotionInference.strip` and added a test asserting that *every
engine parsing model text* calls it. The test passed, then and now:
`CrispasrEngine` does call it — on its other mapper, forty lines from the
one that does not. The test enumerated **engines**, and the pool is not an
engine. `_mapSessionSegments` carries a comment stating the filter sits "at
the only point the tags enter the app"; that sentence was written when it
was true and stayed in place after a second point was added.

The filter now runs in `workerSegmentFromMap`, and the acoustic-event
vocabulary moved from a private helper inside `CrispasrEngine` to
`EmotionInference.eventTags` so both boundaries classify identically —
a private classification list is how one boundary ends up with no
classification.

**This trigger fired on 2026-08-03, on the limb it names last.** The audit
of that date found the audio-Q&A field shipping a placeholder — localised
into all three supported languages — that recommended the prompt *"What's
the speaker's tone?"*. See §2.9. The removal in this section was sound and
remains in force for the SenseVoice path; what it did not survive was a
second path, added for an unrelated feature, that reached the same
capability by a different route and was never checked against this
section. The trigger was written on 2026-08-02 and was met by code already
in the tree on that date.

### 2.9 Audio Q&A ("ask the audio")

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | An instruct-tuned audio LLM (voxtral, qwen3-asr) **answers a user's free-text question about a recording** instead of transcribing it |
| Annex III category | **Not listed — conditional on the input guard.** Would be **1(c)** for any prompt asking the model to infer a speaker's emotions or intentions |
| Art. 50(2) applicability | **Yes** — the answer is model-authored prose, not a record of speech |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk, subject to Art. 50(2)**, on the basis that affective prompts are refused rather than answered |
| Mitigations | `AffectivePromptGuard` refuses emotion/intent prompts at the engine, the HTTP server and the CLI; output flagged `generated: audio-qa` at the engine and marked in every export, the transcriptions endpoint and CLI stdout |

**Discovered 2026-08-03, and it is two findings rather than one.**

**(a) The Annex III limb.** The feature is reached from Advanced Options and
its placeholder text read, in EN, DE and ZH: *e.g. "Summarize" or "What's the
speaker's tone?"*. An LLM asked that question and answering it from audio is
inferring the emotional state of a natural person from biometric data —
Art. 3(39), Annex III 1(c), and Art. 5(1)(f) outright where the recording
comes from a workplace or a school.

The severity is in the **placeholder**, not the field. §2.8 rejected the
Art. 6(3) derogation for the SenseVoice badge because "the app parsed the
tags deliberately, classified them with a dedicated helper, and rendered a
labelled badge, which reads as intent". A shipped, translated hint
*recommending* the tone prompt is intent on the same reasoning, and
Art. 3(39) turns on the purpose a system is offered for. Two other things
made it worse than the badge that was deleted for it: the badge was
display-only, whereas a Q&A answer reaches exports, the share sheet and
history; and `EmotionInference` cannot touch it, because that control matches
a closed set of `<|HAPPY|>` literals at a parse boundary and an answer is
free prose with neither.

**Why the input and not the output.** There is no output-side control
available here. An assertion about a speaker's mood is a sentence like any
other, with no tag to discard and no boundary at which it is distinguishable.
So the control moved to the prompt: `lib/utils/affective_prompt_guard.dart`
refuses emotion, mood, prosody, intent and veracity terms across EN/DE/ZH,
enforced in three places — `CrispasrEngine` (the single point an ask prompt
enters the engine), `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (so the server answers 400
with a reason rather than 500), and the CLI (before the decode, so a refused
run costs nothing).

**Refuse, not disclose.** Art. 50(3) was the wrong instrument: it binds
deployers and presumes the system may lawfully run, whereas Art. 5(1)(f) is a
prohibition the app cannot consent its way past and cannot context-detect.
Outside those contexts the obligation is the Annex III 1(c) one that §2.8
deleted a feature to avoid; answering the prompt and labelling the answer
would have re-acquired it.

**What is not claimed.** The guard is a keyword filter over a free-text
field and a determined user can rephrase past it ("describe the prosody",
"is the speaker being sincere" — both are on the list, but the list is
finite). It is a control against the app *affording* emotion inference,
which is what supplies intended purpose under Art. 3(39); it is not a
guarantee that no model ever emits an affective sentence. Same honest limit
as the discard list in §2.8: the control only works for the terms it names.

**(b) The Art. 50(2) limb.** Q&A answers travelled the transcript pipeline,
so every downstream label described them as speech recognition output —
`NoteExportService` said "Machine-generated transcript — produced by AI
speech recognition", `FileUtils` JSON said "AI-generated synthetic speech",
Obsidian and Logseq tagged them `type: transcript`, and CLI `--ask` wrote
them to stdout bare because the disclosure rule keyed on `--translate`
alone. That is worse than an unmarked file: a reader who trusts the label
reads a model's assertions about the audio as quotations from it. Segments
now carry `generated: audio-qa` from the engine — persisted with the rest of
`metadata`, so a re-export from history months later still knows — and every
exit picks its wording from it.

**This re-open trigger also fired, on 2026-08-03, on its first limb.** The
guard was described above as sitting at "the single point an ask prompt
enters the engine". There were two points. `transcription_screen` dispatches
to `TranscriptionWorkerPool` **directly** — bypassing
`CrispasrEngine.transcribe` entirely — for parallel batch jobs
(`_runJobOnPool`) and for the A/B model comparison, and it passes the user's
`askPrompt` straight through. On that route an affective prompt reached the
model unrefused: the Art. 5(1)(f) and Annex III 1(c) exposure this section
was written to close, open on the app's *batch* path, which is the one most
likely to be pointed at a folder of meeting recordings.

The guard now runs in `TranscriptionWorkerPool.dispatch`, before a worker is
even acquired, so it covers the screen's direct dispatches and the engine's
pooled path alike. The engine keeps its own copy for its non-pooled routes.
Note what the fix does *not* change: the guard is still a keyword filter with
the limits stated below. What changed is that it is now applied everywhere,
which is a different property from being strong.

**Re-opens if** the guard is bypassed, a new generating surface reaches
`setAsk` or `TranscriptionWorkerPool.dispatch` without passing through it,
or any UI copy again suggests an affective prompt. The locale regression test in
`test/synthetic_compliance_test.dart` asserts that no shipped
`advancedAskPromptHint` trips the guard — that test exists because a
placeholder is a recommendation, and a recommendation is how this returned.

### 2.10 Spoken-Language Identification (LID)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Detects the language of speech from audio to pick an ASR decode path (`lid_service.dart`; whisper LID, Silero 95-language, ECAPA voxlingua107) |
| Annex III category | Not listed |
| Art. 5(1)(g) applicability | **No** — language is not among the sensitive attributes that limb enumerates |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** |
| Mitigations | On-device, ancillary to transcription, result is a decode hint and is not stored as an attribute of any person |

**Newly classified 2026-08-03; previously undocumented.** §3.3 asserted
flatly that "no biometric categorisation is performed" without this
subsystem ever having been assessed — the same failure mode that hid the
emotion badge for two audits, and worth recording as such even though the
conclusion is benign.

The assessment: Art. 3(40) reaches systems assigning natural persons to
categories on the basis of **biometric data**, and Art. 3(34) scopes
biometric data to processing that allows or confirms unique identification.
Spoken-language ID does neither — it classifies the signal, not the speaker,
and cannot single anyone out. Art. 5(1)(g)'s prohibition is in any case
confined to deducing race, political opinions, trade-union membership,
religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation; language
is not on that list, and the app draws no inference from the detected
language beyond selecting a model. The result is a transient decode hint,
never persisted against a speaker profile.

**Re-opens if** a detected language is ever stored as an attribute of an
enrolled speaker, or surfaced as a claim about a person rather than about a
recording.

### 2.11 Audio Enhancement (denoise)

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | RNNoise speech enhancement (`/v1/audio/denoise`, CLI `denoise`) |
| Art. 50(2) applicability | **No** — the second subparagraph's carve-out applies |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk, no marking duty** |

**Newly classified 2026-08-03; previously undocumented.** Art. 50(2) exempts
systems performing "an assistive function for standard editing" that do not
substantially alter the input data or its semantics. Noise suppression is the
paradigm case: it removes non-speech energy and changes nothing about what
was said. §2.7 already applied this reasoning to text cleanup and drew the
boundary at rewriting; the same boundary is drawn here, and the output is
correctly unmarked.

**Re-opens if** the enhancement path ever gains a generative component —
speech restoration, bandwidth extension, or any model that *synthesises*
audio the microphone did not capture. That output would be synthetic content
and would need the full §5.2 marking, not this carve-out.

### 2.12 Speaker Diarisation

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Segments a recording by *who spoke when*, without naming anyone (`diarization_service.dart`; vad-turns, pyannote, stereo energy, stereo cross-correlation) |
| Annex III category | **Not listed** — no identification, and 1(a) reaches identification |
| GDPR Art. 9 | **No** — the processing does not pursue "the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person"; it separates voices within one file and links them to nothing |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk** |
| Mitigations | On-device; labels are positional (`Speaker 1`) until the user renames them; embeddings are transient and never written to disk |

**Newly classified 2026-08-02; previously undocumented — and the omission
mattered more than §2.10's did.** Diarisation computes **TitaNet speaker
embeddings** when re-clustering to a requested speaker count
(`diarization_service.dart` §5.8.1), i.e. it derives the same vector type
that §2.4 and the DPIA treat as biometric data — for *every* speaker in any
recording, enrolled or not, consented or not. Two audits assessed the
enrolment path in detail and neither asked what else computes an embedding.

The assessment, and why it lands differently from §2.4: Art. 9(1) GDPR bites
on biometric data processed *for the purpose of uniquely identifying* a
natural person, and Art. 3(35) AI Act scopes biometric identification the
same way. Diarisation pursues neither. It answers "are these two utterances
the same voice?" within one file, discards the vectors when the run ends,
and produces a positional label that resolves to a name only if the speaker-ID
subsystem — which *is* consent-gated (§2.4) — is separately invoked. The
distinction the Regulation turns on throughout is *purpose*, not technique:
the same vector attracts different duties depending on what it is computed
in order to do. That is the same reasoning §3.1 uses to place enrolment
inside the verification carve-out, applied one step earlier.

What follows from that is a boundary rather than a clean bill: the analysis
holds **because the embeddings are transient and unlinked**. `DPIA.md` §1.2
now scopes them explicitly rather than describing only the `.spk` files.

**Re-opens if** a diarisation embedding is persisted, cached across runs,
or matched against anything outside the file it came from. At that point it
is doing what §2.4 does, and it needs §2.4's consent gate.

### 2.13 Assistive text post-processing

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Function | Punctuation and capitalisation restoration (FireRedPunc, fullstop-punc, BiLSTM truecaser), forced alignment (`aligner_service.dart`), written-language ID (CLD3 / GlotLID / FastText), chapter-boundary detection (`chapter_detection_service.dart`) |
| Art. 50(2) applicability | **No** — the second subparagraph's carve-out applies |
| Risk level | **Not high-risk, no marking duty of their own** |

**Newly classified 2026-08-02; previously undocumented.** These are neural
models operating on text and are therefore worth stating rather than
assuming. Art. 50(2) exempts systems performing "an assistive function for
standard editing" that do not substantially alter the input data or its
semantics. Inserting a comma, restoring a capital, aligning a word to a
timestamp, labelling which language a string is in, and cutting a transcript
into chapters all leave the words intact — this is the boundary §2.7 drew
for text cleanup and §2.11 drew for denoise, applied a third time.

Two consequences worth stating, because "no marking duty of their own" is
narrower than it sounds:

- The **transcript they operate on** still carries whatever notice it earned.
  Chapter detection was the case that proved this: its export wrote chapter
  titles — verbatim transcript text — to a shared file with no notice at
  all, while the neighbouring menu entry disclosed. Fixed 2026-08-02; see §5.2.
- Written-language ID classifies a *string*, not a speaker, so it is outside
  Art. 3(40) for the reasons §2.10 gives for the spoken case.

**Re-opens if** any of these gains a generative component — a model that
rewrites rather than repunctuates, or that invents chapter titles instead of
quoting the transcript. Generated titles would be synthetic text and would
need marking in their own right.

## 3. Speaker Identification — Detailed Risk Assessment

CrisperWeaver's speaker identification subsystem uses TitaNet voice
embeddings to match audio segments against a locally-stored speaker
database.

### 3.1 Primary argument — this is verification, not identification

Annex III, Section 1(a) covers **remote biometric identification
systems** and expressly **excludes** "AI systems intended to be used for
biometric verification whose sole purpose is to confirm that a specific
natural person is the person he or she claims to be."

Since v0.9.6 the subsystem is architecturally constrained to exactly
that. `CrispasrSpeakerDB` is opened as a **closed roster**: the caller
must declare, up front, the list of claimed participants
(`expectedNames`) plus an explicit consent attestation
(`consentAttested`); construction throws without the latter. Matching
confirms a claimed participant. It is **never an open 1:N search**
against the full profile database.

CrisperWeaver derives that roster from consent records on disk: a
profile without a persisted GDPR Art. 9(2)(a) consent record is excluded
from the roster and can never be matched. Withdrawal of consent (erasing
the record) therefore removes the speaker from matching automatically.

On this basis the subsystem is **outside Annex III 1(a)** rather than
being a high-risk system that benefits from a derogation.

### 3.2 Secondary argument — Art. 6(3), and its limits

Were a supervisory authority to characterise the subsystem as falling
within Annex III 1(a) anyway, the Art. 6(3) derogation would be argued
on these facts:

1. **No remote biometric identification.** All processing occurs
   exclusively on the user's device. No biometric data is transmitted
   to any server, database, or third party.

2. **No real-time identification.** The system matches pre-enrolled
   speakers against audio files, not against live camera/microphone
   feeds in real time.

3. **No publicly accessible spaces.** The system does not operate in
   publicly accessible physical spaces. It processes audio files
   selected by the user on their personal device.

4. **User-controlled enrollment.** Speakers are enrolled by the user
   with explicit consent. The user has full control over which voices
   are enrolled and can delete any profile at any time.

5. **Not used for law enforcement, border control, or access control.**
   The system has no integration with any surveillance, law enforcement,
   or access control infrastructure.

**Two caveats that the earlier revision of this document omitted:**

- **Art. 6(3) is not self-executing.** A provider relying on the
  derogation must *document* the assessment before placing the system on
  the market, and — under Art. 49(2) — **register the system in the EU
  database**. Invoking the derogation is not the same as escaping
  registration. This matters only if §3.2 ever becomes the operative
  reading: on the §3.1 analysis the subsystem is outside Annex III, so
  Art. 6(3) is never reached and Art. 49(2) does not bite. See §7.3 for
  the four changes that would re-open it.
- **The derogation is void where the system performs profiling** of
  natural persons. CrisperWeaver does not profile: it resolves a
  diarisation label to a name and stores no behavioural, inferential, or
  categorical attributes about any speaker.

### 3.3 What is *not* claimed

No biometric **categorisation** is performed: nothing infers or assigns
sensitive attributes — race, political opinion, trade-union membership,
religion, sex life, sexual orientation — from anyone's biometric data.
Art. 5(1)(g) is not engaged.

**No emotion recognition is performed either** — but that claim now holds
for a different reason than earlier revisions of this section supposed, and
the difference matters if anyone re-derives it.

Those revisions rested the claim on the Chatterbox `[angry]` /
`[whispering]` tags being generation-side prosody controls. That much
remains true: they steer TTS output and infer nothing about any person. But
it was never the whole picture — the SenseVoice ASR backends were running
emotion inference on the recognition side, and the claim was false in
practice from the day that backend was catalogued until 2026-08-02, when
the feature was removed (§2.8). It is true today because the capability was
deleted, not because it never existed.

The distinction to keep hold of is **direction**. A tag that *tells the
model how to sound* is a rendering instruction. A tag that *reports how the
speaker sounded* is an inference about a natural person. Only the second is
Art. 3(39). Any future audit of this section should check the ASR side as
well as the synthesis side — checking only the latter is precisely how this
was missed twice.

**And a third time, by a third route.** The audit of 2026-08-03 found the
claim false again — not on the synthesis side, not on the tag-parsing side,
but in the audio-Q&A prompt, whose shipped placeholder recommended asking
for the speaker's tone (§2.9). Direction was the right test and it was
applied to the wrong surface: the question was asked of *models that emit
labels* and never of *fields that accept prompts*. The claim holds today
because affective prompts are refused at the input, and the refusal is
pinned by a test that reads the shipped locale strings.

**And a fourth time, latently.** The 2026-08-02 audit found the discard
filter written out *inside* `CrispasrEngine` rather than at the app's
boundary, so `HfSpaceEngine` — the cloud path, offered on every platform and
the only engine on the web build — copied the remote server's text into
segments untouched, on both of its parse routes. Nothing reachable exercised
it: the cloud backend list is a hardcoded eleven-entry allowlist with no
SenseVoice-family model in it. That is a real distinction and it is why this
is recorded as latent rather than as a live breach — but it is one line in a
list away, and "the control only works for the terms it names" has a sibling
proposition this section had not stated: *the control only works on the
route it was written for*. The filter now lives in
`EmotionInference.strip`, both engines call it, and a test asserts that
every engine parsing model text does.

**On biometric categorisation**, the claim is now backed by an assessment
rather than an assertion: spoken-language identification (§2.10) is the one
subsystem that assigns any category from voice, and it is outside
Art. 3(40) and Art. 5(1)(g) for the reasons given there. Earlier revisions
of this section stated the conclusion without having identified the
subsystem it had to be true of. Diarisation, assessed at §2.12 on
2026-08-02, is the one subsystem that *derives* biometric vectors outside
the consent-gated enrolment path; it is outside Art. 9 GDPR because it does
not pursue identification, and that conclusion is conditional on the vectors
staying transient.

## 3a. Free and open-source status (Art. 2(12))

CrisperWeaver is released under AGPL-3.0. Art. 2(12) exempts AI systems
released under free and open-source licences from parts of the
Regulation — but that exemption **does not extend to Art. 50**, nor to
prohibited practices or high-risk systems. The transparency obligations
in §5 below apply in full and are not mitigated by the licence. This is
recorded here to prevent the exemption being over-read.

## 4. Art. 5 Compliance Statement (Prohibited Practices)

CrisperWeaver does **NOT** perform any of the practices prohibited
under Art. 5:

- (a) No subliminal, manipulative, or deceptive techniques
- (b) No exploitation of vulnerabilities of specific groups
- (c) No social scoring
- (d) No individual risk assessment for criminal offending prediction
- (e) No untargeted facial image scraping
- (f) No emotion inference in workplace or educational contexts — the
  SenseVoice capability was removed on 2026-08-02 (§2.8) and the audio-Q&A
  route to the same inference was closed on 2026-08-03 (§2.9). Note the
  difference in kind between the two controls: the first is an absence (the
  code was deleted), the second is a **refusal at the input** over a
  free-text field, which is a real control but a defeatable one. This limb
  is therefore satisfied by design rather than by construction, and §2.9
  states the limit plainly rather than claiming more
- (g) No biometric categorisation for sensitive attributes (§3.3)
- (h) **No real-time remote biometric identification in publicly
  accessible spaces** — all processing is on-device, user-initiated,
  on user-selected files

## 5. Art. 50 Compliance Summary (Transparency)

### 5.1 Who is bound by what

Art. 50 splits its duties between two roles, and CrisperWeaver occupies
only one of them. Conflating the two — as the earlier revision of this
document did — overstates what the software can discharge on the user's
behalf.

| Para | Binds | Who that is here |
|---|---|---|
| 50(1) interaction disclosure | **Provider** | CrisperWeaver |
| 50(2) machine-readable marking of synthetic content | **Provider** | CrisperWeaver |
| 50(3) emotion recognition / biometric categorisation notice | **Deployer** | n/a — emotion recognition removed (§2.8), no biometric categorisation (§3.3) |
| 50(4) deep fake + public-interest text disclosure | **Deployer** | **the end user**, not CrisperWeaver |

CrisperWeaver cannot discharge a deployer's Art. 50(4) duty. What it
does is make compliance the default and non-compliance deliberate: the
beep disclaimer is applied automatically to every cloned and
voice-converted output, and suppressing it requires a written
attestation that is logged for audit.

### 5.2 Implementation status

| Obligation | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 50(1): Users informed of AI interaction | First-use transparency dialog (EN/DE/ZH), enumerating every AI subsystem and which of them can use the network once enabled | Done |
| Art. 50(2): Machine-readable AI marking — audio | Spread-spectrum watermark, verified post-embed by probing the PCM; C2PA COSE/X.509 manifest; WAV LIST/INFO + ID3v2 tags | Done |
| Art. 50(2): Machine-readable AI marking — text | Transcript exports carry a synthetic-content disclosure by default; OCR, LLM summaries and translations carry one on screen and on copy; the HTTP translation endpoint sets `x-content-ai-generated` and a `_disclosure` field | Done |
| Art. 50(2): Machine-readable AI marking — audio Q&A | Segments flagged `generated: audio-qa` at the engine and persisted with `metadata`; every export picks its wording from the flag; `/v1/audio/transcriptions` sets `x-content-ai-generated` + `_disclosure` + `"task": "audio-qa"`; CLI `--ask` attaches the disclosure | Done (2026-08-03) |
| Art. 50(2): Marking of machine translation on the transcriptions endpoint | `/v1/audio/transcriptions` with `translate` / `target_language` returned bare text with a hardcoded `"task": "transcribe"`; now marked on all five response formats | Done (2026-08-03) |
| Art. 50(4): Deep fake disclosure — voice cloning | Mandatory beep disclaimer; suppression requires a logged attestation. Applies on the GUI, server (`/v1/audio/speech`) and CLI (`synthesize --voice`) paths | Done |
| Art. 50(4): Deep fake disclosure — speech-to-speech | Same beep path via `voiceConverted` / `_writeMarkedWav(deepfake: true)`; `/v1/audio/s2s` consent-gated; CLI `s2s` marked | Done |
| Art. 50(3): Emotion recognition notice | Not applicable — the capability was removed rather than disclosed (§2.8), and the audio-Q&A route to it is refused at the input rather than disclosed (§2.9). Emotion tags are discarded at the engine's parse boundary and on every CLI output format | n/a |
| Art. 50(2): Marking survives editing | Trim / cut / split carry the source C2PA manifest into the derived file as a `c2pa.edited` action and re-emit the LIST/INFO tags, instead of re-encoding a bare 44-byte WAV; MP3 re-encode carries ID3v2 provenance, and containers that cannot carry a manifest are logged as watermark-only | Done |
| **Art. 50(2): Marking survives *persistence*** | `HistoryEntry.toJson` listed segment fields by hand and omitted `metadata`, so the `generated` flag died on save. Now round-tripped whole, with unencodable values dropped rather than thrown | Done (2026-08-02) |
| Art. 50(2): Machine translation marked in the GUI | `CrispasrEngine` stamps `generated: translation`, so the GUI exporters reach the same conclusion the CLI and the HTTP server already reached from the request | Done (2026-08-02) |
| **Art. 50(2): Marking on the worker-pool path** | The `generated` stamp lived in `CrispasrEngine.transcribe`. `TranscriptionWorkerPool.dispatch` is reached *without* it — directly by parallel batch jobs and the A/B comparison — and stamped nothing, so Q&A answers and machine translations produced in batch were labelled transcripts by every export, by history, and by the clipboard. The rule now lives in `GeneratedKind` and both callers use it | Done (2026-08-03) |
| **Annex III 1(c): emotion filter at the pool boundary** | `workerSegmentFromMap` rebuilt every pooled segment with the model's text copied straight through, so SenseVoice emotion tags reached the UI and exports whenever the worker pool ran — the default for batch. Unlike the `HfSpaceEngine` gap of 2026-08-02 this was **live, not latent**. Filter applied at that boundary; event vocabulary moved to `EmotionInference.eventTags` so both boundaries classify alike | Done (2026-08-03) |
| **Art. 5(1)(f): affective-prompt guard on the pool path** | Same bypass: the screen's direct `pool.dispatch` passed the user's ask prompt to the model unscreened. Guard moved into `dispatch`, ahead of worker acquisition | Done (2026-08-03) |
| **Art. 50(2): Marking survives *Copy* and *Share*** | Five call sites handed transcript text to the clipboard or the share sheet with no notice — the transcription screen's Copy and Share, the output widget's copy-segment and copy-all, and History's Copy — while the Export button beside each of them marked the same bytes. All five now route through `FileUtils.withDisclosure`, which applies the `.txt` rule: a transcript stays bare, an audio-Q&A answer or a machine translation is marked | Done (2026-08-03) |
| Art. 50(2): Chapter exports | YouTube-format and Podcasting 2.0 chapter files carry the notice their segments earned | Done (2026-08-02) |
| Art. 50(2): Cloud TTS output | `HfSpaceTtsService` probes remote output for a watermark and embeds one locally when absent, verifying the result | Done (2026-08-02) |
| Annex III 1(c): emotion tags on every engine | The discard filter moved from inside `CrispasrEngine` to `EmotionInference.strip`, and the cloud engine now applies it on both of its parse paths | Done (2026-08-02) |

**Scope note — every generating path, not just the GUI.** The audit of
2026-08-02 found the marking pipeline was implemented on the Flutter side
only: `bin/crisperweaver.dart` wrote bare 44-byte WAVs from both
`synthesize` and `s2s`, so headless output carried no beep, no manifest,
no provenance chunk and no watermark verification. The WAV encoder now
lives in `lib/utils/marked_wav.dart` and is shared by the app and the CLI
so the two cannot drift apart again.

The audit of 2026-08-02 found the same shape of gap twice more, in
directions the first pass did not look: the CLI was inside the *audio*
marking scope but still wrote machine-translated *text* to stdout bare
(fixed — `translate` and `transcribe --translate` now attach the shared
`AiTextDisclosure`, with `--no-disclosure` as the explicit opt-out), and
`AudioEditService` decoded to PCM and re-encoded a bare 44-byte WAV, so
trimming a generated clip stripped the manifest and the LIST/INFO tags the
app had itself written (fixed — provenance is carried across the edit). In
both cases the watermark survived and the *machine-readable* mark did not,
which is precisely the layer that container metadata is supposed to supply.

**The 2026-08-03 audit found the same shape a fourth time**, and the pattern
is now specific enough to name: each time, a duty was implemented on the
surface where the feature was designed and missed on a surface that reached
the same capability by another route. GUI first, then the CLI, then the edit
path, and now the HTTP transcriptions endpoint — which discharged the text
duty on `/v1/translations` while `/v1/audio/transcriptions?translate=true`
produced the same machine-translated text unmarked, under a hardcoded
`"task": "transcribe"`. `AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md` §1.4 asserted that generated
output crossing the server "carries the same marking as the GUI's"; that
claim was false for the one endpoint nobody re-read. The check that would
have caught all four is the same: enumerate the *routes to a capability*,
not the features.

**The 2026-08-02 audit found a fifth, and it is the one that undoes the
other four.** Every previous fix marked output correctly *at the moment it
was produced*. None of them survived being written to disk:
`HistoryEntry.toJson` enumerated segment fields by hand and `metadata` was
not among them, so `generated: audio-qa` — the flag this section had
introduced the day before, and which both compliance documents described as
"persisted with `metadata`, so a re-export from history months later still
knows" — was discarded the moment a run was saved. A Q&A answer re-exported
from History was therefore labelled a transcript by every format, and as
`.txt` carried no notice at all, `.txt` being the one format whose notice is
conditional on the flag.

That is worth separating from the other four. The first four were *routes to
a capability*; this one is a **route through time**. A mark that holds only
while the object is in memory is not a mark on the artefact, and the check
that catches it is different in kind: not "which surfaces produce this?" but
"what does this look like after a round-trip?" Two further findings of the
same audit — chapter exports written with no notice while the neighbouring
menu entry disclosed, and machine translation marked by the CLI and the
server but not by the GUI, because translation left no trace on the segments
for the GUI to read — are the fourth-audit pattern recurring, and both are
now fixed at the point that serves every surface: the engine stamps the
kind, and everything downstream reads it. `test/synthetic_compliance_test.dart`
pins the round-trip, both new disclosures, and the back-compat path for
history files written before the fix.

**The sixth audit found a sixth, and it is the plainest of the six.** Every
one of the five above concerned an artefact that gets *written* — a file, a
history record, an HTTP response, a line on stdout. So each fix was made where
a writer lives, and the checks that followed each fix enumerated writers. The
two exits that write nothing were never enumerated, and they are the two the
user reaches first: **Copy** and **Share**.

Five call sites handed transcript text to the OS bare — `_handleShareAction`'s
`share` and `copy` on the transcription screen, `_copySegmentText` and
`_copyAllText` in the output widget, and History's Copy button. Each sits
immediately beside an Export control that marks the identical bytes, so the
same audio-Q&A answer was a marked artefact if saved as `.txt` and an unmarked
one if copied. The gap was not a wrong disclosure or a missing rule — the rule
existed and was correct; `AiTextDisclosure.forKind` had been the single source
of it since the fourth audit. These five simply never asked it anything.

Two things make this worse than a plain omission rather than merely equal to
one. First, the clipboard is the **weakest** exit, not the strongest: a `.txt`
file at least persists a filename and a timestamp a recipient can interrogate,
whereas pasted text arrives with nothing at all attached, which is precisely
the situation Art. 50(2) exists to address. Second, the Art. 50(1) first-use
notice told every user, in all three shipped languages, that *"AI-generated
text carries a disclosure when you copy or export it"*. Half of that sentence
was false when it was written. A transparency notice that overstates the
transparency measures is a worse defect than a silent gap, because it induces
the reliance the gap then disappoints.

The rule now lives in `FileUtils.withDisclosure` and is the `.txt` rule
exactly — an ordinary transcript stays bare, because Art. 50(2) reaches
synthetic content and a record of what a person actually said is not that;
generated prose is marked in whatever it leaves in. Copy-segment passes the
single segment rather than the run, so lifting one answer out of a mixed
transcript still carries the notice. `test/synthetic_compliance_test.dart`
pins the rule and, separately, asserts that all five call sites route through
it — a unit test on the helper cannot see call sites that never call it, which
is the whole of what went wrong here.

**The generalisation, after six.** "Enumerate the routes to a capability, not
the features" was the right instruction and it kept being applied to too small
a set, because *route* was read as *code path that produces an artefact*. The
sixth audit's correction is that an exit does not have to produce anything: the
clipboard, the share sheet, a socket, a paste buffer are all places content
leaves, and none of them writes a file. The question that catches all six is
**"where can this text end up outside the app?"** — not "what writes it".

**And the seventh, found in the same pass, is the one that should worry a
reader of this document most**, because it is not about an exit at all. Three
compliance controls — the affective-prompt guard (§2.9), the emotion-tag
discard (§2.8) and the `generated` stamp — were all implemented inside
`CrispasrEngine.transcribe`, each documented as sitting at "the single point"
or "the only point" its input enters the app. **None of those sentences was
true.** `TranscriptionWorkerPool` is a second entry to the same native
sessions, `transcription_screen` dispatches to it directly for parallel batch
jobs and the A/B comparison, and `workerSegmentFromMap` is a second parse
boundary that every pooled segment crosses — including the ones the engine
itself produces when a pool is loaded. All three controls were absent there.

The distinction from the six above: those were **duties** discharged on some
surfaces and not others, and the fix each time was to reach the missing
surface. This is a **chokepoint that was never a chokepoint**, asserted to be
one in three separate places in this document, in the engine's own comments,
and in a regression test that enumerated *engines* and therefore could never
see it.

There is a fourth assertion, and it is the one that would have turned an
auditor away at the door. `transcription_screen` introduces the pool under a
comment reading: *"The pool's `dispatch` is a bare `session.transcribe(samples)`
— no VAD slicing, no resume offset routing, **no Q&A / translate** /
beam-search / best-of … So pool eligibility is per-job: jobs that need any of
those features fall through to the serial path."* Read at face value that
closes two of the three limbs outright: no Q&A and no translation on the pool
means no affective prompt and nothing to stamp. It is **stale**. `poolEligible`
excludes exactly two things — a resume offset and `tdrz` — and `_runJobOnPool`
passes `askPrompt`, `translate` and `targetLanguage` straight through. The
capability grew and the comment did not. Worth recording because it is a
distinct failure mode from the others here: not a control in the wrong place,
but a *true-when-written* comment that later described the code as safer than
it was, sitting exactly where someone checking would look first. The recurring instruction has to be extended accordingly: after
locating the point a control sits at, the next question is **"what else
reaches the thing this control is protecting?"** — here, the native session —
rather than trusting the comment that says nothing does.

The three controls now sit at the pool boundary as well, and the
`generated`-kind rule was consolidated into `GeneratedKind` so there is one
implementation rather than two that must agree. `test/synthetic_compliance_test.dart`
asserts the pool applies each control and that neither caller re-implements
the precedence rule locally.

**And the structural answer, finally attempted:
`test/compliance_boundaries_test.dart`.** Every fix above was made at the site
that was missing it, and every fix shipped with a test asserting *that site*
was covered. Not one of those tests could see the next gap, because each was
written in the shape of the defect it closed. Six rounds is enough evidence
that the defect is not any individual call site but the absence of anything
watching the set.

That file enumerates every call site in `lib/` at four boundaries — content
exits, segment construction from model text, ask-prompt entry, and the
filter's own polarity — and compares them against a reviewed allow-list. A new
or moved site fails CI with a note naming the duty and the section to read. It
does not test behaviour and cannot tell whether a new site is correct; it
guarantees only that nobody adds one *without being asked the question*. Given
that all six findings were omissions rather than errors, that is the property
worth buying. Its counting is deliberately brittle — brittleness is the
mechanism.

**The session wrapper was attempted and abandoned for something better.**
The plan recorded here was to route every `CrispasrSession` through one
guarded wrapper. Enumerating the call sites to build it immediately found
four more unfiltered constructions (§2.8), one of which reads from
`crispasr.drainStreamedSegments()` — a free function, not a session method.
A session wrapper would have shipped with that gap still open, and would have
looked like a structural guarantee while being one more incomplete
enumeration of sources.

The filter therefore moved to the **destination type** instead:
`TranscriptionSegment.fromModelText` is the single supported way to build a
segment from model output. This is stronger than the wrapper in the way that
matters — it does not depend on knowing where text comes from, only on where
it goes, and everything goes to a `TranscriptionSegment`. It is weaker in one
way, stated rather than glossed: nothing forces a *new* call site to choose
the factory over the plain constructor. That is what the tripwire covers, and
the two are complements rather than alternatives.

**The same move was then applied to the prompt, contradicting what this
section said an hour earlier.** The text above read: *"A prompt has no single
destination type to attach a control to; it goes into a session setter."*
That is false, and the mistake is worth keeping rather than editing away,
because it is the same category error as "the only point the tags enter the
app" — reasoning about where a value *goes* instead of about what the value
*is*. A prompt is a value, so the value can be the type.

`ScreenedAskPrompt` can only be constructed by `ScreenedAskPrompt.screen`,
which screens or throws. `session.setAsk` now takes `.value` off one of
these, so a new entry point cannot forget the guard — it can only fail to
compile. All four entry points (engine, pool, HTTP server, CLI) were
converted, and a fifth was added deliberately: **the worker isolate screens
again on arrival**, because the wire format is an untyped map and the type
cannot cross it. That re-screening is placed outside the FFI-probe
`catch (_)` that surrounds the neighbouring setters — a feature probe may be
silently swallowed, a compliance refusal may not.

`test/compliance_boundaries_test.dart` covers the one case the type cannot:
`setAsk` is upstream API typed on `String`, so passing a bare string still
compiles. The tripwire reads every `.setAsk(...)` argument in `lib/` and
`bin/` and requires it to come from a screened prompt.

**What is still not fixed, and now genuinely is the weakest control.** The
screening remains `AffectivePromptGuard`, a finite keyword list over free
text. Making a guard unforgettable is a different property from making it
strong, and §2.9 states the second limit plainly. There is no structural move
left for that one: it is a semantic judgement about natural language, and the
honest position is that the app refuses the prompts it can recognise and does
not claim to recognise all of them.

### 5.3 Art. 50(5) — clarity and accessibility

Art. 50(5) requires the information owed under 50(1)–(4) to be given "in a
clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first
interaction or exposure", and to "conform to the applicable accessibility
requirements". Earlier revisions of this document did not address the
second clause at all.

| Disclosure | Timing | Accessibility |
|---|---|---|
| 50(1) first-use notice | Blocking dialog on first launch, before any use | Native `AlertDialog` — traversable and readable by the platform screen reader; scrollable so it is not truncated on small displays |
| 50(4) beep disclaimer | Prepended to the audio | Audible only — **deliberately redundant** with the C2PA manifest and container tags, which are the channel available to a deaf recipient or an automated checker |
| 50(2) text disclosure | Prefixed to the text itself | Plain text, so it inherits whatever the reading tool provides |

The one place the mark is single-channel is a container that can carry
neither manifest nor tags, where the spread-spectrum watermark stands alone
(§7.4). That is a machine-readable channel with no human-readable or
accessible counterpart, and it is logged as such at the point it happens
rather than assumed adequate.

## 6. Art. 4 — AI Literacy

Art. 4 has applied since 2 February 2025 and obliges providers and
deployers to take measures ensuring a sufficient level of AI literacy
among staff and others operating the system on their behalf.

CrisperWeaver is developed by a single maintainer with no staff, so the
staff-training limb is inapplicable. The obligation is discharged toward
users by:

- the first-use transparency notice enumerating every AI subsystem in
  use and stating that all processing is on-device;
- `docs/AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md` §"Instructions for use" (Art. 13), which
  documents capabilities and known limitations;
- explicit accuracy caveats where output is most likely to be
  over-trusted — the OCR disclosure tells the user to verify before
  relying on the text.

| C2PA signing for MP3 exports | **Done** — ID3v2 provenance on the MP3 path; AAC/Opus are watermark-only and warn. §7.4's "no MP3 export exists" was incorrect |
| Art. 53 GPAI obligations for the `cstr/*` account | **Closed** (2026-08-03) — see §7.5b. 34 repos carry the duty (27 merges + 7 LaserRMT); all 34 verified by re-fetch to hold explicit 53(1)(c) and 53(1)(d) sections. The last outstanding one, `cstr/Flora_7B-laser`, was published on 2026-08-03. The 3 narrow trained-from-scratch models are outside Art. 53 entirely — not GPAI under Art. 3(63) (§7.5a). Deadline had been 2 August 2027 under Art. 111(3); met early |

### 7.1 Abuse-reporting channel

The recipient of a synthetic clip is the person most likely to notice
misuse, and they typically have no idea what produced it. A policy
published only on a website is unreachable to someone holding a WAV, so
the reporting channel is embedded **in the C2PA manifest of every file
the app generates** (`crisperweaver.abuse-reporting` assertion:
acceptable-use policy URL, reporting URL, and a plain-language note).
It therefore travels with the audio. A GitHub issue template backs the
URL.

The channel is deliberately honest about its limits. CrisperWeaver is
offline software with no accounts, no servers and no kill switch: the
project can confirm whether a file carries our watermark and manifest,
help interpret that, and harden the marking — it **cannot** identify who
generated a file, disable an installation, or take content down. The
template says so up front and redirects urgent harm to law enforcement
and national DPAs.

### 7.2 Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-generated Content

Final since 10 June 2026; adherence is voluntary while the underlying
Art. 50 duties are binding. Signatories gain predictability and legal
certainty across Member States and avoid individual compliance
assessments by market surveillance authorities.

Its core commitment — outputs marked in a machine-readable format and
detectable as artificially generated, by means that are "effective,
interoperable, robust and reliable as far as technically feasible" — is
already met, and on the robustness limb arguably exceeded:

| CoP expectation | CrisperWeaver |
|---|---|
| Machine-readable marking | C2PA manifest (COSE-signed where available) + WAV `LIST`/`INFO` + ID3v2 tags |
| Detectable as AI-generated | Spread-spectrum watermark, **verified after embedding** by probing the PCM, not assumed |
| Interoperable | C2PA is the industry standard; the watermark is cross-compatible with the CrispASR / CrispTTS detectors |
| Robust | Watermark survives re-encoding; container metadata does not, and that limit is disclosed to users rather than glossed |
| "As far as technically feasible" | Sub-100 ms and digitally silent audio cannot carry a spectral watermark; the app **reports** this instead of claiming a mark it did not make |

Note the benefit precisely: signatories can *demonstrate* compliance and
have enforcement focused on monitoring adherence rather than individual
assessment by each national market surveillance authority. This is **not**
an Art. 40 "presumption of conformity" — that concept attaches to
harmonised standards, not codes of practice.

**Decision (2026-08-02): not signing, for now.** This is a judgement call
rather than a technical gap, and the reasoning is recorded here so it can
be revisited on its merits rather than re-argued from scratch.

Adherence is an **ongoing** commitment to the Code's measures across
whatever the software becomes, not a one-time attestation about the
version that exists today. CrisperWeaver is under active development and
its surface keeps moving — the last two audits alone added an LLM text
subsystem to the marking scope, brought the CLI inside it, and closed two
consent gates on paths that did not exist a few releases earlier.
Committing a moving target to a fixed set of measures invites a worse
position than never signing: diverging after signing reads as breaking a
commitment, whereas a non-signatory is simply assessed on the merits.

The benefit accrues mainly to providers who expect to be assessed by
national market surveillance authorities — a posture that does not fit an
AGPL project with no accounts, no servers, and no commercial deployment.

What this costs is small and stated plainly: no ability to *demonstrate*
compliance by reference to the Code, so the technical measures have to
stand on their own. They do — every limb in the table above is met, and
the robustness limb is arguably exceeded. **Art. 50 is binding either way
and is met either way**; the Code is a route to showing that, not a
source of the obligation.

**Revisit if** the project stabilises its generating surface, gains a
commercial or institutional deployment, or is contacted by a market
surveillance authority. Signing remains open at any time (the
initial-signatories list closed 22 July 2026, which affects listing order
and nothing else): complete the Signatory Form and email it to
`CNECT-AIOFFICE-CODE-OF-PRACTICE-TRANSPARENCY@ec.europa.eu`, signed by
someone with authority to bind the provider.

### 7.3 Art. 49(2) registration

Art. 49(2) obliges a provider who considers an **Annex III** system not
high-risk under the Art. 6(3) derogation to register it in the EU
database before placing it on the market.

On the operative analysis (§3.1) the speaker-identification subsystem is
biometric **verification**, which Annex III 1(a) expressly excludes — so
it is not an Annex III system at all, Art. 6(3) is never reached, and
Art. 49(2) does not bite.

**A second Annex III subsystem briefly existed and was removed.** The audit
of 2026-08-02 found emotion recognition (§2.8), listed at Annex III
**1(c)** with no verification-style carve-out to fall outside of. Rather
than argue the Art. 6(3) derogation — which would have required documenting
the assessment before placing on the market *and* registering under
Art. 49(2), since invoking the derogation is not an escape from
registration — the capability was **deleted**. Annex III 1(c) is therefore
not engaged, and no registration question arises from it.

| Subsystem | Annex III | Registration |
|---|---|---|
| Speaker identification | Outside 1(a) — verification (§3.1) | Not applicable |
| Emotion recognition | Removed 2026-08-02 (§2.8) | Not applicable |

The speaker-identification conclusion depends on the closed-roster
architecture and fails if that changes. **Re-open registration for that
subsystem if any of these become true:**

- matching stops being roster-constrained (an open 1:N search over the
  profile database);
- the roster stops being consent-derived, so speakers can be matched
  without a recorded lawful basis;
- the subsystem is used to profile speakers rather than resolve a
  diarisation label to a name;
- the app gains a deployment context in Annex III terms (employment,
  law enforcement, access control, education).

Deadline if it ever applies: the Annex III obligations bind from
**2 December 2027**.

### 7.4 C2PA for MP3 and the compressed containers

Carried over from PLAN §13.3g. The 2026-08-01 revision recorded this as
"not applicable — no MP3 export exists". **That was wrong**, and the
2026-08-02 audit corrected it: `AudioEditService.exportEncoded` encodes
MP3, AAC-LC and Opus through the bundled libglint. It has no UI caller, so
nothing in the shipped app can reach it today — but a marking gap that
exists only in unreachable code is a gap waiting for the day someone wires
a button to it, and "no export path exists" was a claim about the codebase
that the codebase did not support.

Now implemented rather than deferred:

- **MP3** carries ID3v2 `AI_GENERATED` provenance via
  `AudioWatermarkService.injectMp3Metadata`, applied when the source
  carried a provenance manifest.
- **AAC / Opus** cannot carry a manifest through this path. The watermark
  in the samples is the only mark that survives, and that is **logged as a
  warning at the point of export** rather than passing silently — the same
  posture as the post-embed watermark verification failure.

**Resolved 2026-08-03: fail-closed.** `exportEncoded` now refuses when the
source carries a provenance manifest and the target container cannot, throwing
`UnmarkableContainerException` and **deleting the file the encoder has already
written** — returning an error while leaving unmarked AI-generated audio on
disk would have been the worst of both outcomes. Callers that want the export
anyway pass `allowUnmarkedContainer: true`, which restores the old
mark-and-warn behaviour as a deliberate, logged decision rather than a
default.

The deferral below was the wrong instinct and is kept as written so the
correction is visible. "Revisit when it is wired up" means deciding a
compliance question at the exact moment a feature is waiting on the answer,
which is when the convenient answer wins. Deciding it while the path is
unreachable cost nothing and is the same reasoning applied to the Wyoming
bind address (§7.6): set the safe default before anyone depends on the unsafe
one.

The superseded text: *the remaining open question is whether the AAC/Opus case
should be* **fail-closed** *(refuse to export AI-generated audio to a container
that cannot carry the machine-readable mark) rather than mark-and-warn. It is
left as mark-and-warn while the path is UI-unreachable; revisit when it is
wired up, because that is when the watermark floor (PLAN §15.8) starts
carrying real weight on its own.*

### 7.5 Art. 53 — GPAI obligations for the `cstr/*` HuggingFace account

This concerns the maintainer rather than the app, but it arises from the
same activity and is recorded here so it is not overlooked.

**Rewritten 2026-08-02 after an inventory of the account, which the earlier
revision of this section had never done.** That revision described the
account as third-party speech models converted to GGUF, assessed it on that
basis, and closed with "**Re-open this** if the project ever fine-tunes,
merges, or distils a model rather than converting one." The trigger had
already fired, years before the sentence was written. An enumeration of all
499 model repos found:

| What it is | Repos | Who is the provider |
|---|---|---|
| Format conversion / quantisation of a **third party's** model | 428 | Upstream. The argument below holds |
| Conversion of the **maintainer's own** derivative | 26 | Provider duties attach at the base model, not the conversion |
| **Genuine derivative** — 27 mergekit merges, 7 LaserRMT modifications, 4 fine-tunes | 41 | **Plausibly the maintainer** |
| **Trained from scratch by the maintainer** | 3 | **The maintainer**, without qualification |

The last two rows are the point. `posformer-crohme-GGUF` is named like a
conversion and its card says the weights were *retrained from scratch* on
CROHME 2014 + MathWriting with the maintainer's own hyperparameters;
`tab-labeler-onnx` documents a training run on GuitarSet; and
`posformer-training-checkpoints` holds that run's checkpoints. Two further
repos are mixed at file level (`truecaser-de`, `tabcnn-onnx`): converted
upstream weights sitting beside weights trained here.

**The conversion argument, which still governs 428 repos:**

- **Art. 53(2) exempts free and open-source GPAI models** from the
  technical-documentation duties in 53(1)(a) and (b), provided the model is
  released under a licence allowing access, use, modification and
  distribution, with parameters and architecture publicly available. These
  repos meet that; the exemption falls away only for models with
  **systemic risk** (Art. 51: ~10²⁵ FLOP training compute), which nothing
  in this account approaches.
- **What survives the exemption** is 53(1)(c) — a policy to comply with
  Union copyright law — and 53(1)(d) — a sufficiently detailed public
  summary of training content. Both attach to whoever counts as the
  model's provider.
- **For a pure conversion the maintainer is not that provider.** Format
  conversion changes the numeric representation, not the model: no
  training, no fine-tuning, no change to architecture or capability. The
  upstream research teams remain the providers. A quantiser is closer to a
  distributor than to a provider of a new model.

**For the 44 derivative and self-trained repos that argument is
unavailable**, and stating it on their cards would be a false compliance
claim rather than cheap insurance. Merging, LaserRMT rank reduction, ORPO
fine-tuning and training from scratch all place a *new* model on the Union
market. 53(1)(c) and 53(1)(d) survive the FOSS exemption and therefore
attach. What exists today: the 27 merges each publish their mergekit config
and constituent models, which is a real factual base for 53(1)(d) but is not
a training-content summary; the 4 fine-tunes name a base and only one names
its training set; **6 of the 7 LaserRMT repos have no card at all**, which
is modified weights published with zero attribution. No repo states a
copyright policy.

Two obstacles to closing 53(1)(d) honestly, recorded rather than glossed:

- **The merge lineage is broken.** 24 `cstr/*` models named as `base_model:`
  no longer exist, so for several merges the chain cannot be reconstructed
  by reading cards — `llama3.1-8b-spaetzle-v119` is built from four models
  that are all gone. Either the lineage is rebuilt from local mergekit
  configs or the cards should say the chain is not fully reconstructible.
  Claiming a summary that cannot be traced would be worse than admitting
  the gap.
- **14 conversion repos have an unverified upstream** (13 without a card).
  Nothing is written to those until the upstream is confirmed from the
  weights or the upload history; an inferred provenance statement is the
  precise failure this section exists to prevent.

Status: the provenance block is being applied to the 428 + 26 conversion
repos, which makes the argument above checkable on each card rather than
asserted here. The 44 derivative and self-trained repos are **open** — they
need a copyright policy and a training-content summary, hand-written per
model, and no automated pass can produce those.

**Re-open the conversion analysis** if a repo currently classified as a
conversion turns out to carry weights that were trained, merged or modified
here. The inventory found three such repos hiding behind conversion-shaped
names, so the classification is evidence-based per repo rather than derived
from the naming convention.

#### 7.5a Re-checked 2026-08-03: "it's all conversions" does not hold

The proposition that the account is only format conversions and quantisations
was put again and checked against the live cards rather than against this
document. It is refuted on both limbs, by the repositories' own metadata:

- **`cstr/posformer-crohme-GGUF`** — the card reads *"retrained from scratch
  on CROHME 2014"* and, under Provenance, *"These weights were trained by
  this repository's maintainer, not converted from someone else's model."*
- **The Spaetzle series** — `Spaetzle-v8-7b`, `-v12-7b`, `-v31-7b` and the
  rest carry the tags `merge`, `mergekit`, `lazymergekit`, each with three or
  more `base_model:` entries from unrelated third parties, and `-v31-7b`
  additionally declares `base_model:finetune`. A mergekit merge of three
  other people's models is a **new model placed on the Union market**. It is
  not a change of numeric representation, which is the whole of what the
  conversion argument in §7.5 rests on.

So the count stands, but **the scope is narrower than §7.5 stated, in the
maintainer's favour**, and the correction is worth making precisely:

- **Art. 53 binds providers of *general-purpose AI models*** — Art. 3(63),
  a model displaying significant generality and capable of competently
  performing a wide range of distinct tasks. The 7B LLM merges, the LaserRMT
  rank reductions and the ORPO fine-tunes are that.
- **The three trained-from-scratch repos are not.** `posformer-crohme`
  recognises handwritten mathematical expressions; `tab-labeler-onnx` labels
  guitar tablature; `posformer-training-checkpoints` holds the former's
  checkpoints. These are narrow, single-task models — AI systems, not GPAI —
  so **Art. 53 does not reach them at all**, and §7.5's framing of them as
  "the maintainer, without qualification" overstated the duty. They were the
  most alarming row in that table and they are the one row that carries no
  Art. 53 obligation.

**What is genuinely open, then:** Art. 53(1)(c) — a copyright policy — and
Art. 53(1)(d) — a public training-content summary on the AI Office template —
for the ~41 LLM merges, LaserRMT modifications and fine-tunes. Both survive
the Art. 53(2) FOSS exemption, which lifts only 53(1)(a) and (b).

**And the deadline is not imminent.** Art. 111(3) gives GPAI models **placed
on the market before 2 August 2025** until **2 August 2027** to comply. The
Spaetzle merges date from 2024, so that is the operative date for essentially
all of them — not 2 August 2025, which applies to models released after it.
This was missing from §7.5 and is the single most useful fact in it: the work
is real, it is bounded, and it is not late.

The honest shape of that work: 53(1)(c) is one short published policy that can
be identical across every repo. 53(1)(d) is per-model, but for a merge the
truthful summary is the constituent models and their declared training data —
which the mergekit configs already record — plus, where the chain is broken
(24 `cstr/*` base models no longer exist), a statement that it is not fully
reconstructible. §7.5 already says a claimed-but-untraceable summary would be
worse than an admitted gap, and that remains the right call.

#### 7.5b Verified against the live account, 2026-08-03: 33 of 34 are done

§7.5 and §7.5a both describe this work as outstanding. **It is very nearly
finished**, and the two sections were reasoning from the state of the account
on 2026-08-02 rather than from the account.

Enumerated via the Hub API: 499 model repos, 44 carrying `merge` / `mergekit` /
`lazymergekit` tags, of which 13 are GGUF quants of the maintainer's own
merges. Removing those and the `int4-inc` / `mlx-4bit` quants leaves **27
distinct merges**, plus **7 LaserRMT repos** — 34 repositories where the
conversion argument is unavailable and Art. 53(1)(c)+(d) attach.

Every one of the 34 now carries a `README.md`. **33 of them carry explicit
Art. 53(1)(c) and 53(1)(d) sections**, written during the 2026-08-02 sweep,
each recording the base model verified from the repo's own `config.json`
rather than inferred from its name. §7.5's "6 of the 7 LaserRMT repos have no
card at all" was true when written and is no longer true.

**One repository was outstanding:** `cstr/Flora_7B-laser`, created 2024-03-18,
whose entire card was the line *"experimental laserRMT version of
ResplendentAI/Flora_7B"* — 85 bytes, no copyright policy, no training-content
statement, no architecture record. It was missed by the sweep that fixed its
six siblings, which is the same per-item-rather-than-per-class gap this
document keeps recording, appearing here in the documentation work itself.

Two facts checked before writing its card, because a provenance claim that is
merely plausible is the failure §7.5 exists to prevent:

- the base is recorded in the repo's own `config.json` as
  `_name_or_path: ResplendentAI/Flora_7B` — confirmed from the weights, not
  read off the repository name;
- both repositories declare `cc-by-sa-4.0`, so this one redistributes under
  the terms it received. That check matters because three unrelated `cstr/*`
  repos were found relicensing non-commercial upstreams as permissive; this
  is not one of them.

The base is itself a merge (it ships `mergekit_config.yml`), so the applicable
training content is that of *its* constituents. The card says so and declines
to restate a chain it cannot verify.

**Status: closed 2026-08-03.** The card was published, and all 34 repositories
were then re-fetched and checked to carry both an explicit `53(1)(c)` and an
explicit `53(1)(d)` section. None is missing either. The
remaining honest gaps are the ones §7.5 already names and which no card can
close: 24 `cstr/*` models named as `base_model:` no longer exist, so several
merge lineages are not fully reconstructible from cards alone, and the affected
cards say that rather than inventing a chain.

### 7.6 The Wyoming ASR socket

`AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md` §1.4 described the app's two self-hosted interfaces —
the OpenAI-compatible HTTP server and the Wyoming-protocol ASR socket — as
"both bound to localhost and both off unless started by the user". The audit
of 2026-08-03 checked that sentence for the first time. It was true of the
HTTP server (`ServerService` defaults to `127.0.0.1`) and false of the
Wyoming socket, which bound `InternetAddress.anyIPv4` — every interface on
the machine, so any device on the same network could have submitted audio
and read back the transcript.

Two qualifications, both of which cut in the same direction as §7.4 did for
the MP3 path:

- **It is latent, not live.** `wyomingServiceProvider` returns null and no
  production code constructs `WyomingService`; only the unit test does. The
  socket cannot be opened by a shipped build.
- **That is a reason to fix it, not to leave it.** §7.4 already settled this
  question for `exportEncoded`: "a marking gap that exists only in
  unreachable code is a gap waiting for the day someone wires a button to
  it". The same holds for a bind address, and more sharply — wiring up a
  feature is the moment nobody re-reads its defaults.

The default is now `InternetAddress.loopbackIPv4`, with the interface a
constructor parameter and a warning logged whenever it is non-loopback.
Home Assistant normally runs on a different host, so a real integration will
need to widen it; that is now an explicit decision rather than an inherited
default.

**What this is and is not.** It is not an Art. 50 defect — the socket
transcribes and does not generate, so no marking duty attaches to it — and
it is recorded here rather than in §5 for that reason. It is a defect in the
**Annex IV technical documentation**, which stated a fact about the system
that was not true, and a latent confidentiality exposure for audio the DPIA
treats as processed exclusively on-device. Both matter: Annex IV is a
description of the system, and a description nobody checks is an assertion.

## 9. Document History

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-03 | **Seventh audit — store-readiness, and the first where the AI Act controls came through clean.** All 155 compliance tests pass, every §2 classification was re-read against the code, and no new route to a generating capability had appeared since round 6. The one finding that touches this document is that `STORE_LISTING.md` still carried the absolute claim round 2 retracted here on 2026-08-02 — *"no cloud, no accounts, no data collection"* and *"no data leaves your phone or computer"* — while §1 and `PRIVACY.md` §3.2/§3.3 had been corrected around the two opt-in network features. Stated precisely, because overstating it would repeat the error: this is **not** an Art. 50 defect. Art. 50 governs the marking of synthetic content, not marketing copy, and every marking obligation remained met throughout. It is App Store Guideline 2.3.1 and consumer law, and it *undercuts* the Art. 50(1) first-use notice, which correctly enumerates which subsystems can use the network — the listing told a prospective user none of them could. Fixed against `PRIVACY.md`, pinned by `test/store_listing_claims_test.dart` in both directions (the absolutes must not return **and** the opt-in features must stay named). The other two findings are platform, not regulatory, and are recorded in `PLAN.md` §17: the watch folder died silently under the macOS App Store sandbox because a user-selected grant does not survive a relaunch, and `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` described the developer's hot-reload use rather than the server the user can actually start. The lesson this round adds to "enumerate the routes to a capability": **a claim is a surface, and a build target is a route** — the places a statement about the software is written down include the ones outside `lib/`. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit, remaining gaps closed.** Three, all of which this document had described as either fixed or as acceptable deferrals. (a) The affective-prompt guard was per-entry-point, and §5.2 had asserted an hour earlier that no structural fix existed because "a prompt has no destination type" — the same category error as "the only point the tags enter the app", reasoning about where a value goes rather than what it is. `ScreenedAskPrompt` is now the only thing `setAsk` accepts, so a new entry point cannot forget the guard, only fail to compile; the worker isolate re-screens on arrival because the type cannot cross an untyped wire format, placed outside the FFI-probe swallow that surrounds its neighbours. (b) **Word tokens were never filtered by any version of this control** — every mapper stripped the segment text and copied `w.text` through, so a tag emitted as its own token reached the word-level view and the JSON export while the segment text beside it was clean. Now stripped in the factory, with tag-only tokens dropped. (c) §7.4's AAC/Opus question is resolved fail-closed rather than deferred again: refusing while the path is unreachable costs nothing, whereas "revisit when it is wired up" means deciding a compliance question with a feature waiting on the answer. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit, fifth finding — found while building the fix for the first.** Enumerating call sites to wrap the CrispASR session turned up **four more** unfiltered model-text constructions, all inside `CrispasrEngine`, the file every audit treated as the one that got this right: the streamed-segment drain (interim segments pushed to the live transcript view, so emotion tags were briefly visible in the UI), `_mapWhisperSegments`, and both halves of the streaming controller. The first of those reads from a *free function*, `drainStreamedSegments()`, not from the session — so the planned session wrapper would have shipped with the gap still open while looking like a structural guarantee. The filter therefore moved to the **destination type**: `TranscriptionSegment.fromModelText` is now the only supported way to build a segment from model output, so completeness no longer depends on enumerating sources. Seven attempts to place this control at "the parse boundary" is the evidence that no such single boundary exists on the source side. The same move is not available for the affective-prompt guard, which has no destination type; that asymmetry is stated at §5.2 as the weakest remaining control. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit — and its central finding is not an exit but a chokepoint that was never one.** Three compliance controls lived inside `CrispasrEngine.transcribe`, each documented here and in the code as sitting at "the single point" its input enters the app: the affective-prompt guard (§2.9), the emotion-tag discard (§2.8), and the Art. 50(2) `generated` stamp. `TranscriptionWorkerPool` is a second entry to the same native sessions — `transcription_screen` dispatches to it directly for parallel batch jobs and the A/B model comparison, and `workerSegmentFromMap` is a second parse boundary every pooled segment crosses — and **all three controls were absent there**. So on the pooled path, which is the default for batch: SenseVoice emotion tags reached the UI, history and exports; affective ask prompts reached the model unrefused; and Q&A answers and machine translations were labelled transcripts everywhere. Unlike the `HfSpaceEngine` gap of the fifth audit, none of this was latent — SenseVoice is a catalogued local backend. The fifth audit's own regression test passed throughout, because it enumerated *engines* and a worker pool is not an engine. All three controls now sit at the pool boundary; the acoustic-event vocabulary moved out of a private engine helper into `EmotionInference.eventTags`, and the generated-kind rule into `GeneratedKind`, so there is one implementation of each rather than two that must agree. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit, fourth finding (§7.5b).** Checked the Art. 53 item against the live account rather than against this document, which had described it as broadly outstanding. It is nearly finished: of the 34 repositories where the conversion argument is unavailable (27 merges + 7 LaserRMT), **33 already carry explicit 53(1)(c) and 53(1)(d) sections** from the 2026-08-02 sweep, each with the base model verified from `config.json` rather than inferred from the repo name. §7.5's "6 of the 7 LaserRMT repos have no card at all" was true when written and is stale. One repository was missed by that sweep — `cstr/Flora_7B-laser`, whose whole card was an 85-byte sentence — which is the same per-item-rather-than-per-class gap this document keeps recording, this time in the documentation work itself. Its licence was checked against the base before writing (both `cc-by-sa-4.0`, so no relicensing issue), and its base was read from the weights' own `_name_or_path`. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit, third finding (§7.5a).** The "the account is only conversions and quants" reading was put again and checked against the live HuggingFace cards rather than against this document. Refuted: `posformer-crohme-GGUF`'s card says the weights were *retrained from scratch* and were *"trained by this repository's maintainer, not converted from someone else's model"*, and the Spaetzle series carries `merge`/`mergekit`/`lazymergekit` tags with three-plus third-party `base_model:` entries each. But the re-check also **narrowed the duty in the maintainer's favour**: Art. 53 binds providers of *general-purpose* models under Art. 3(63), so the three narrow trained-from-scratch repos (handwritten-maths OCR, guitar-tab labelling) fall outside it entirely — §7.5 had listed them as the clearest case of provider duties attaching. What remains open is 53(1)(c)+(d) for the ~41 LLM merges, LaserRMT modifications and fine-tunes, with an **Art. 111(3) deadline of 2 August 2027** for models placed on the market before 2 August 2025 — a date §7.5 never stated. |
| 2026-08-03 | **Sixth audit, second finding.** Generated text leaving the app unmarked through the two exits nobody had enumerated, because neither writes anything: **Copy and Share**. Five call sites — the transcription screen's share and copy, the output widget's copy-segment and copy-all, and History's Copy — handed audio-Q&A answers and machine translations to the clipboard or the share sheet bare, each sitting immediately beside an Export control that marked the identical bytes. The rule was correct and had been since the fourth audit; these five never invoked it. Worse than a silent gap, because the Art. 50(1) first-use notice promised in all three languages that "AI-generated text carries a disclosure when you **copy** or export it". Fixed at one helper (`FileUtils.withDisclosure`) applying the existing `.txt` rule, with a test that asserts the call sites route through it rather than only that the helper works. This narrows the standing instruction: "enumerate routes to a capability" had been read as "enumerate code paths that produce an artefact", and the right question is **where can this text end up outside the app**. Separately, found `AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md` §1.4 asserting both self-hosted interfaces were localhost-bound while the Wyoming ASR socket bound `InternetAddress.anyIPv4` — latent, since no shipped build can construct it, and fixed by defaulting to loopback (§7.6). Re-verified the six subsystem classifications added by the third to fifth audits, the affective-prompt guard on all four entry points, the consent gate on both enrolment paths, and the audio marking chain; no further live defect found. |
| 2026-08-02 | **Fifth audit.** Found the fourth audit's central fix silently undone by persistence: `HistoryEntry.toJson` omitted segment `metadata`, so `generated: audio-qa` was discarded on save and a re-export from History labelled a language model's answer a transcript — as `.txt`, with no notice at all — while §5.2 and `AI_ACT_TECHNICAL.md` §5.1 both asserted the flag was persisted. Also found chapter exports writing transcript text to a shared file unmarked while the neighbouring menu entry disclosed, and machine translation marked by the CLI and the HTTP server but not by the GUI, because translation left no trace on the segments; both fixed at the engine, which now stamps the kind for every surface to read. Corrected the transcript disclosure, which told recipients the *speech* was synthetic. Moved the emotion-tag filter out of `CrispasrEngine` to `EmotionInference.strip` and applied it in `HfSpaceEngine`, which had been parsing remote text untouched (latent — no SenseVoice backend is offered on that route). Marked cloud TTS output, which returned remote audio unwatermarked and unprobed. Classified two previously undocumented subsystem groups: diarisation (§2.12 — the one that derives biometric vectors outside the consent gate) and assistive text post-processing (§2.13). Extended the Art. 50(1) notice, which had not enumerated audio Q&A, diarisation, spoken-language ID or denoise. Note also that the fourth audit's entries are dated 2026-08-03 throughout but were committed on 2026-08-02; the dates are left as written and the discrepancy recorded here rather than rewritten. This entry was itself first drafted as 2026-08-04 and corrected to the actual date before release — flagging a date defect and then committing the same one would have been the more embarrassing of the two. Rounds three, four and five all landed on 2026-08-02. |
| 2026-07-16 | Initial risk classification document |
| 2026-08-01 | Audit revision. Reframed speaker ID as biometric **verification** under the closed-roster API (§3.1) with Art. 6(3) demoted to a fallback argument and its registration/profiling caveats stated (§3.2). Added Art. 2(12) open-source scope note (§3a), provider/deployer split (§5.1), Art. 4 (§6), open items (§7), and post-Digital-Omnibus dates (§8). |
| 2026-08-03 | **Fourth audit.** Found the §2.8 re-open trigger had already fired: the audio-Q&A field shipped a placeholder in EN/DE/ZH recommending *"What's the speaker's tone?"* — the app suggesting the one prompt that re-acquires Annex III 1(c) (§2.9a). Closed at the input with `AffectivePromptGuard` (engine, HTTP server, CLI) rather than by disclosure, since Art. 5(1)(f) is a prohibition and no output filter can catch free prose; the defeatable nature of that control is stated rather than glossed. Also found Q&A answers labelled as *transcripts* by every export (§2.9b) and machine translation returned unmarked by `/v1/audio/transcriptions` while `/v1/translations` disclosed (§5.2) — the fourth instance of one duty implemented per-feature and missed per-route. Classified two previously undocumented subsystems, spoken-language ID (§2.10) and denoise (§2.11), both not high-risk. Corrected the SRT disclosure, which used WebVTT's `NOTE` syntax and was not valid SRT. |
| 2026-08-02 | **Third audit.** Found the app performed **emotion recognition** (SenseVoice emotion tags rendered as a per-segment badge) — a subsystem §3.3 had expressly denied across two prior audits, because the claim was checked against the synthesis screen and never against the ASR engine. **The capability was removed** rather than disclosed: Annex III 1(c) would have brought high-risk obligations from 2 Dec 2027 for a badge nothing persisted. Rewrote §2.8 as a removal record with a re-open trigger, corrected §3.3 to explain why the no-emotion-recognition claim is true now for a different reason than before, and closed the Annex III limb of §7.3. Added §5.3 for the previously unaddressed Art. 50(5) accessibility clause. Corrected §7.4, which claimed no MP3 export path existed when `AudioEditService.exportEncoded` has one. Recorded the CLI text-disclosure and edit-strips-provenance gaps as fixed (§5.2). |
| 2026-08-02 | Second audit. Corrected the inaccurate "no data is transmitted" claim in §1 and classified the previously unclassified LLM text subsystem (§2.7) — the only one whose data can leave the device. Recorded that Art. 50(2) text marking now covers LLM summaries and translations, not only OCR, and that the CLI is inside the marking scope (§5.2). Added the GPAI note (§7.5). Closed the Code of Practice item as a decision not to sign, with reasoning and re-open triggers (§7.2). |
