# CrisperWeaver — Technical learnings

Things we spent hours figuring out while porting CrispASR's 10-backend FFI surface into a cross-platform Flutter app. Nothing here is news to someone who's shipped a native-code Flutter app before — everything here is something we'd have saved a day by knowing up front.

If a learning is still live (affects current work), it's linked from [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md). If it's purely historical (a bug we fixed), it lives here.

---

## Dart FFI

### Generic helpers over `NativeFunction<T>` fail under `flutter test`, not `dart test`

**Symptom:** a helper like

```dart
R _tryLookup<T extends Function, R extends Function>(String sym) {
  return lib.lookupFunction<NativeFunction<T>, R>(sym);
}
```

compiles and runs under `dart test` but fails in `flutter test` with

> Expected type 'NativeFunction<T>' to be a valid and instantiated subtype of 'NativeType'

**Reason:** the Flutter test runner rewraps `NativeFunction<T>` generics differently from the standalone VM; `T` isn't visible as an instantiated type at the FFI lookup site.

**Fix:** drop the generic. Per-symbol `providesSymbol` probe + concrete `lookupFunction<Concrete, Concrete>`:

```dart
if (!lib.providesSymbol('crispasr_audio_load')) return null;
final fn = lib.lookupFunction<
    Int32 Function(Pointer<Utf8>, Pointer<Pointer<Float>>, Pointer<Int32>, Pointer<Int32>),
    int Function(Pointer<Utf8>, Pointer<Pointer<Float>>, Pointer<Int32>, Pointer<Int32>)
>('crispasr_audio_load');
```

More boilerplate, but it works everywhere.

### `calloc<Utf8>(n)` fails: Utf8 is not a `SizedNativeType`

**Symptom:** allocation lines like `calloc<Utf8>(16)` fail compilation on newer Dart FFI:

> 'Utf8' is not a 'SizedNativeType'

**Fix:** allocate as bytes, then cast:

```dart
final buf = calloc<Uint8>(16).cast<Utf8>();
```

### Optional FFI symbols: probe before bind

If your library may or may not expose a symbol (e.g. new helpers added in CrispASR 0.4.x), always `providesSymbol('foo')` before `lookupFunction`. Otherwise any older copy of the dylib crashes the app on startup.

### `CrispASR(modelPath)` loads the path as a *whisper* context — don't feed it auxiliary models

The `crispasr.CrispASR(modelPath)` constructor calls `whisper_init_from_file` on `modelPath`. Some instance methods (`vad`, `vadSlices`) take a *separate* `modelPath:` argument and never touch `_ctx` — so it's tempting to do `CrispASR(vadModel)` just to reach them. Don't: a VAD/LID/punc model loaded as a whisper context is a degenerate `_ctx`, and `dispose()` → `whisper_free()` over it **SIGABRTs the whole isolate**. (`VadService` did exactly this and was a silent no-op — §9.5.) Either open the context on a real ASR model and pass the aux model only as a method arg, or — better for VAD — call the *free* C function `crispasr_vad_slices` directly (no context). See `lib/native/vad_native.dart`.

### Verify which entrypoint actually works — the obvious one can fail silently

`crispasr_vad_segments` (the binding's `vad()`) uses whisper's *native* VAD loader and returns `-2` ("model init failed") for the Silero asset and the whisper-vad GGUF. The working call is the unified dispatcher `crispasr_vad_slices` (`vadSlices()`). When a binding exposes two similar entrypoints, check the C source's return codes against the model type you're actually passing before wiring a service to one — a swallowed `-2` looks identical to "no speech".

### A `dart run` CLI can't use the Flutter service layer

`bin/crisperweaver.dart` runs under plain `dart run`, which has no `WidgetsFlutterBinding`, `path_provider`, `rootBundle`, or Riverpod container — so the app's `services/` (which depend on all of those) are unreachable. Wrap `package:crispasr` (pure-Dart FFI) directly instead. The CLI therefore reaches *engine* capabilities at parity with the GUI, but not GUI orchestration (history, presets, cleanup); that split is documented in `docs/PARITY.md`.

## Dylib bundling

### `libcrispasr` is a compatibility alias, not a separate library

CrispASR's core dylib is still called `libwhisper.dylib` (historical — the project is a whisper.cpp fork). `libcrispasr.dylib` is a symlink (Unix) or copy (Windows) created by CMake post-build. Both point to the same file and export the same symbols; the Dart loader tries `libcrispasr` first, falls back to `libwhisper`.

**Don't** expect them to be independently versionable — they're the same code.

### On macOS, DT_NEEDED sibling dylibs must live in `Contents/Frameworks/`

The app bundles ten dylibs: `libwhisper.dylib` plus `libparakeet`, `libcanary`, `libcohere`, `libqwen3_asr`, `libgranite_speech`, `libcanary_ctc`, `libvoxtral`, `libvoxtral4b`, `libwav2vec2-ggml` — all linked as DT_NEEDED from libwhisper itself. `dyld` finds them via `@rpath/@loader_path` (CMake sets this correctly at build time), but they must physically sit next to `libwhisper.dylib` inside `Contents/Frameworks/`.

`scripts/bundle_macos_dylibs.sh` does the copy + ad-hoc codesign. Skipping the codesign causes Gatekeeper to refuse to load the auxiliary dylibs with a permissions error that looks like "library not found" — very misleading.

### On Linux, DT_NEEDED siblings go into `bundle/lib/` — plus version symlinks

Unlike macOS, Linux's `libwhisper.so` has a SONAME with a version number (e.g. `libwhisper.so.1`). The CMake build produces three files:

```
libwhisper.so -> libwhisper.so.1
libwhisper.so.1 -> libwhisper.so.1.8.4
libwhisper.so.1.8.4
```

The CI bundle script picks the real file (`.so.1.8.4`), copies it as `libwhisper.so`, then symlinks `libcrispasr.so → libwhisper.so`. Both open paths work. Missing sibling `.so`'s (parakeet/canary/...) are skipped with a warning — a slim build stays valid.

### Static libs linked into shared libs need `-fPIC`

**Symptom:** linking `libwav2vec2-ggml.a` (a CMake `STATIC` library) into `libwhisper.so` fails on Linux with

> relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

**Fix:** `set_target_properties(wav2vec2-ggml PROPERTIES POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)` in the CMakeLists for that target. macOS is lenient (always PIC); Linux enforces it.

## Flutter + macOS

### CardTheme / DialogTheme / TabBarTheme were renamed in 3.38

If you pinned Flutter ≤ 3.35 and bumped to 3.38.5, any custom theming like

```dart
cardTheme: CardTheme(elevation: 2)
```

stops compiling. The replacements are `CardThemeData`, `DialogThemeData`, `TabBarThemeData`. Same constructor args, just the `*Data` suffix.

### Abstract exception classes can't be thrown

`EngineException` was declared abstract (`abstract class EngineException implements Exception`). Calling `throw EngineException('...')` fails compilation. Either declare it concrete, or add a `GenericEngineException(this.message)` concrete subclass for the "no specific reason" cases. We did the latter.

### `RenderFlex overflowed by N pixels` on macOS initial window

On macOS the default NSWindow opens at a smaller-than-you-think size. If your top `Scaffold` has an AppBar + tabs + search field + status chip all in one row, you will overflow at 1024-wide. Iterative fixes we ended up with:

- `LayoutBuilder` with `constraints.maxWidth < 720` → wrap wide-form widgets in a narrow variant.
- Remove tab icons (just labels).
- `isDense: true` on the search field.
- Use `titleMedium` instead of `headlineSmall` in AppBar.
- Set `minSize` on the NSWindow in `MainFlutterWindow.swift`.
- Default window to 1200 × 800.

The Flutter inspector's "overflow by X pixels" message counts from the *outside in* — start with the top-level row and work inward. Don't bother with `Expanded` on the first pass; it usually isn't what you want.

### Xcode "Run Script" phase warning is noise

> Run script build phase 'Run Script' will be run during every build because it does not specify any outputs.

Flutter's own generated script phase. Cosmetic. Ignore.

## Flutter dependency pinning

### `material_color_utilities` is a constant moving target

Flutter SDK pins an exact version; ecosystem packages pin a broader range; the two occasionally disagree. Our override:

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  material_color_utilities: ">=0.8.0 <0.12.0"
```

Revisit after every Flutter minor bump.

### `intl` version collision with `flutter_localizations`

Same issue. `flutter_localizations` pins `intl` tightly; packages like `share_plus` pin a range that doesn't overlap. Override:

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  intl: ">=0.19.0 <0.21.0"
```

### `record_linux` 0.7.x breaks `record` 5.x's platform interface

`record 5.1.2` wants `record_linux ^1.3.0`, but pub's resolver picks `0.7.2` without an override. Symptom: Linux build fails because the mic-record plugin can't find `LinuxRecorder.registerWith()`. Override:

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  record_linux: ^1.3.0
```

### `just_audio` has no native Windows / Linux implementation

Symptom (issue #1, Windows): `MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method disposeAllPlayers on channel com.ryanheise.just_audio.methods)` fires on the very first `AudioPlayer` constructor — so the app crashes before any UI renders. `just_audio`'s pubspec only declares `android` / `ios` / `macos` / `web` plugin platforms. The Flutter tool happily builds for Windows and Linux without warning, then the platform channel resolves to nothing at runtime.

Fix: route those two platforms through `just_audio_media_kit` (libmpv-backed). Initialise it before any player is constructed, but only on the affected platforms — calling it on macOS/iOS/Android is a no-op but cleaner to guard:

```yaml
dependencies:
  just_audio: ^0.10.5
  just_audio_media_kit: ^2.1.0
  media_kit_libs_windows_audio: any
  media_kit_libs_linux: any
```

```dart
// main.dart, before runApp()
if (Platform.isWindows || Platform.isLinux) {
  JustAudioMediaKit.ensureInitialized();
}
```

The Flutter generated plugin registrants pick up `media_kit_libs_windows_audio` automatically on the next `flutter build windows`. No manual edits to `windows/flutter/generated_plugin_registrant.cc`.

## CI patterns

### Sibling-repo checkout

CrisperWeaver's `pubspec.yaml` has `crispasr: { path: ../CrispASR/flutter/crispasr }`. CI's `checkout` actions therefore both live under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    path: repos/CrisperWeaver
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    repository: CrispStrobe/CrispASR
    path: repos/CrispASR
```

`working-directory: repos/CrisperWeaver` on every subsequent step. The `../CrispASR/...` path resolves naturally.

Lesson: don't try to use a git submodule for this. Submodules pin a SHA; we want `main` both places. Sibling checkout is messier but gives you the "develop both repos in lockstep" workflow you actually wanted.

### `cancel-in-progress` is what you want

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

When you push three commits in quick succession, only the last one runs to completion — the first two get cancelled mid-stream. Saves runner minutes and keeps CI status readable.

### `flutter analyze` infos/warnings ≠ errors

By default, `flutter analyze` exits non-zero on infos and warnings too. We only want to fail on errors:

```yaml
- run: |
    set +e
    flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos --no-fatal-warnings
    status=$?
    if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
      echo "::error::flutter analyze reported errors"
      exit $status
    fi
```

### `cppcheck` hates third-party single-header libraries

`miniaudio.h` is 95K lines. cppcheck spends minutes on it and generates hundreds of warnings for code that isn't ours. Suppress by filename:

```yaml
--suppress="*:src/miniaudio.h" --suppress="*:*stb_vorbis.c"
```

## WAV parsing

### Signed 16-bit PCM: use `getInt16`, not `getUint16` then subtract

Classic off-by-one-bit mistake. Reading the sample as unsigned and subtracting 32768 to "re-center" gives you an output amplitude that's *almost* right but off by 1 LSB. Just use `byteData.getInt16(pos, Endian.little)` and divide by 32768 — floats handle the range directly.

### Chunk iteration: pad to 2 bytes

WAV chunks are padded to 2-byte boundaries. After reading a chunk, `if (chunkSize % 2 != 0) offset++;` — otherwise a fmt chunk with odd size (rare but legal) misaligns every subsequent chunk and you get "No data chunk found".

## macOS lifecycle + ggml teardown race

### Dispose heavy native state on `AppLifecycleListener.onExitRequested`

On the red-X close of a Flutter macOS app, the runtime calls `exit()` → `__cxa_finalize_ranges()`. Any global `std::vector<ggml_metal_device>` destructor that runs at that moment tries to free residency sets, but ggml-metal's background 500 ms keep-alive dispatch queue (`__ggml_metal_rsets_init_block_invoke`) is still alive → `ggml_metal_rsets_free` asserts → `abort` → macOS shows a "closed unexpectedly" dialog.

**Fix:** wire `AppLifecycleListener(onExitRequested: ...)` in the root Stateful widget. Inside it: dispose the engine (which tears down the whisper context, which cancels ggml-metal's dispatch queue), flush your log sink, *then* return `AppExitResponse.exit`. By the time `exit()` runs the global destructors, the Metal state is gone.

```dart
_lifecycle = AppLifecycleListener(onExitRequested: () async {
  ref.read(transcriptionServiceProvider).dispose();
  await Log.instance.enableFileSink(false);  // flush + close
  return AppExitResponse.exit;
});
```

`AppExitResponse` is in `dart:ui`, not `package:flutter/services.dart` as the name suggests — `import 'dart:ui' show AppExitResponse;`.

### Heavyweight Swift code in `MainFlutterWindow.swift` lingers forever

The standard Flutter-for-macOS template has a 26-line `MainFlutterWindow.swift`. Ours had 387 lines of dead `AudioProcessingPlugin` Swift (AVFoundation + Accelerate FFT via `DSPSplitComplex`). It was legacy from the method-channel audio path — replaced by CrispASR's FFI `crispasr_audio_load` long ago — but the Swift was still compiled, still registered the plugin, and still held `AVAudioEngine` references that contributed to the "closed unexpectedly" crash.

**Lesson:** when you rip out a method-channel-based feature on one platform, search for its *other* platform counterparts. I missed this on macOS after cleaning it from iOS. Grep for the plugin name across `ios/` AND `macos/`.

## Remote catalog naming drift

### Don't hardcode third-party file names — probe and build the catalog at runtime

We shipped a hardcoded catalog of `ModelDefinition` entries pointing at `huggingface.co/cstr/*-GGUF/resolve/main/*.gguf` URLs. Each entry was a guess based on the backend's HF-Space naming. Four of them were wrong — e.g. `cohere-transcribe-03-2026-q5_0.gguf` (our guess) vs `cohere-transcribe-q5_0.gguf` (actual). Users got `HTTP 404 "Entry not found"` with no way to recover.

**Fix:** add a `BackendRepo` struct with just `repoId` + `baseName`, and call `GET huggingface.co/api/models/<repo>?blobs=true` at runtime. Parse every `.gguf` sibling into a `ModelDefinition` with the **real** filename and **real** byte-size. Merge live-probed entries over the hardcoded defaults. Auto-probe on first model-manager open so users never have to know about a "refresh" button.

**Corollary:** at most, hardcode repo-level info (repo ID, display prefix), never file-level (filename, URL, size). HF file names drift when model authors republish.

## Logging infrastructure

### Disable Dio's `LogInterceptor` in apps that have their own log view

`package:dio`'s `LogInterceptor(requestHeader:true, responseHeader:true, responseBody:true)` emits ~50 trace lines per HTTP request (every header, every response body byte). We gated it on `kDebugMode` — which is true under `flutter run`, which is where users actually read in-app logs. Our own `download start` / `download done` + DioException summary in the catch already capture the signal. The interceptor was pure noise.

**Lesson:** log only at application-event granularity (download started, download failed with HTTP 404), not at network-protocol granularity. If you need network-protocol logs, gate them behind a separate "HTTP verbose" toggle, not a debug-mode flag.

### `stderr.writeln` on Windows GUI builds throws *async*, past your `try`/`catch`

Issue #1's log showed an `[uncaught] FileSystemException: writeFrom failed (errno=6)` for every log line on Windows, originating from `Log._emit → stderr.writeln`. The `_emit` site already had a sync `try { stderr.writeln(...) } catch (_) {}` around it. The error still escaped.

**Reason:** `IOSink.writeln` enqueues bytes synchronously and returns; the actual write happens later in the event loop via `_StdConsumer.addStream → _StdSink.writeln`. When stderr's underlying handle is invalid — exactly the case for a Windows GUI build detached from the console — the FileSystemException is raised in that later micro-task and bypasses the sync try/catch entirely. It lands on `platformDispatcher.onError` instead, surfacing as `[uncaught]` on every log line.

**Fix:** classify the stream once at startup with `stdioType(stderr)` and skip the write entirely when it returns `StdioType.other` (the value Dart uses for detached streams):

```dart
final bool _stderrUsable = stdioType(stderr) != StdioType.other;
// ...
if (kDebugMode) {
  debugPrint(formatted);
} else if (_stderrUsable) {
  try { stderr.writeln(formatted); } catch (_) {}
}
```

`stdioType` covers terminal, pipe, file, and other (the only category that actually fails). Wrapping `runZonedGuarded` around `main()` is the alternative, but it pushes complexity onto every other site in the app for one specific failure mode.

## Theming and dark mode

### Don't hardcode text colors — use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onSurface`

The Logs screen hardcoded `Colors.black87` as the default text colour for every log row. Black-on-dark-surface in dark mode → invisible text. Same mistake lurks wherever `Colors.black*` / `Colors.white*` is used without a theme-aware fallback. The fix is always `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.onSurface` (or `onPrimary` etc. for tinted backgrounds).

Legitimate uses of `Colors.white` still exist — specifically `foregroundColor: Colors.white` paired with `backgroundColor: Colors.red` on destructive-action buttons. Those are OK because both colors are explicit.

## Architecture decisions

### CoreML as an opt-in inside whisper.cpp, not a separate engine

Early scaffolding had a separate `EngineType.coreML` + iOS `CoreMLWhisperPlugin` that talked to a method channel. That's the wrong shape — whisper.cpp ships its own CoreML integration (`WHISPER_USE_COREML`) which loads a `.mlmodelc` for the encoder forward pass, uses the Apple Neural Engine, and falls back to the GGML encoder on error — all through the existing `whisper_full_*` API. Net effect: CoreML acceleration rides through the *same* `CrispASREngine` path with no engine-level fork.

Lesson: resist the urge to model every hardware accelerator as a separate engine. If the underlying library already has a "try accelerator X, fall back to CPU" path, expose it as a build-time flag, not a user-visible engine switch. You save the duplicated tokenizer / audio-loader / context-management code that each engine would otherwise need.

### Model format ≠ engine

`ModelType.whisperCpp` is a *file-format marker* (GGML / GGUF binary loadable by whisper/CrispASR context). It's NOT coupled to a hypothetical `WhisperCppEngine`. Same file lands in `CrispASREngine.loadModel()`. When renaming or culling engine types, grep carefully — the `whisperCpp` token has two unrelated meanings.

## Process / project hygiene

### Don't narrate a rename halfway

Renaming `susurrus-flutter` → `CrisperWeaver` across a Flutter project touches bundle IDs (macOS / iOS / Android), Kotlin package directories, Dart `package:` imports in tests, CI workflow paths, README prose, and a dozen `pubspec.yaml`-referenced identifiers. Mid-rename build attempts created empty shell directories at the intermediate path (`crisperweaver-flutter/`) that Xcode picked up as "stale file" warnings for weeks. Fix: rename atomically via a Python script, run `flutter clean`, then build. Don't `flutter build macos` between step 3 and 4 of the rename.

Corollary: grep the whole tree for the old name *before* declaring the rename done. It catches README references, doc URLs, and assert-messages you'd otherwise miss.

### AGPL-3.0 attribution via LicenseRegistry

Flutter's `showLicensePage` aggregates every pub dep's license. For *native* code bundled via dylib (CrispASR, whisper.cpp, ggml, miniaudio), pub doesn't know about them — register them manually at startup:

```dart
// lib/services/native_licenses.dart
LicenseRegistry.addLicense(() async* {
  yield LicenseEntryWithLineBreaks(
    ['CrispASR'],
    await rootBundle.loadString('assets/licenses/CrispASR.txt'),
  );
});
```

Keep the raw license text in `assets/licenses/` and declare the asset in `pubspec.yaml`. The *About* screen then shows the full list, satisfying AGPL's "provide the license with the conveyed work" requirement.

### Don't commit build artefacts

We accidentally committed `crispasr/target/` (Cargo build dir) and `Cargo.lock` from CrispASR during a CI fix. `.gitignore` additions + `git rm --cached` fixed it. Lesson: when fixing CI across a multi-repo tree, run `git status` frequently.

## VAD wire-up (v0.1.7, April 2026)

### Bundled GGUF asset + first-use extract is the cleanest pattern

The Silero VAD GGUF (~885 KB) ships as `assets/vad/silero-v6.2.0-ggml.bin` and `lib/services/vad_service.dart` exposes a single `ensureModel()` call that copies the rootBundle asset to `<appCache>/vad/silero-v6.2.0-ggml.bin` on first use. Whisper's `params.vad_model_path` / the session API's `transcribeVad(..., vadModelPath)` both take a concrete file path — they can't read Flutter asset URIs directly. The extract-to-cache step is a one-liner but it's *the* interop glue between Flutter and any FFI that wants a filesystem path. This pattern generalises: any future shared-library feature that wants a model path (pyannote GGUF for diarize, whisper-tiny for LID, canary-CTC for alignment) uses the same "bundle as asset → extract to cache → pass path" recipe.

### Engine dispatch sits at `CrispASREngine`, not the service layer

`TranscriptionService.transcribeFile` was the natural place to put "extract VAD model + pass to engine". Resist adding feature flags one layer higher. The service knows about files and jobs, the engine knows about FFI. `_performTranscription(vad, vadModelPath, ...)` forwards to `engine.transcribe(vad, vadModelPath)` unchanged — the service doesn't care which engine consumes the flag, and the engine dispatches whisper vs session internally. That separation kept v0.1.7 to ~10 lines of service-layer change for a feature spanning every backend.

### Whisper vs session-API are two different VAD paths

`CrispASREngine.transcribe()` branches on `_model != null` (whisper, direct `crispasr.CrispASR`) vs `_session != null` (everything else, via `CrispasrSession`):
- **Whisper path**: sets `TranscribeOptions.vad = true` + `vadModelPath = path`. whisper.cpp's internal `whisper_full_params.vad` does the slicing + internal 30 s seek. No stitching.
- **Session path**: calls `CrispasrSession.transcribeVad(pcm, vadModelPath)` — the C-ABI `crispasr_session_transcribe_vad` does VAD + merge/split + stitch with 0.1 s gaps + single transcribe + timestamp remap in one FFI hop.

Both paths take the same `vad: true` flag from the UI toggle. The fact that they dispatch differently internally is invisible to callers — that's what the DRY refactor bought us.

### Pinning to a sibling CrispASR checkout via `path:` dep

`pubspec.yaml` declares `crispasr: { path: ../CrispASR/flutter/crispasr }`. This means every commit here implicitly pins to whatever's in the sibling `main` branch at build time. For v0.1.7 we needed `CrispasrSession.transcribeVad` which landed in `package:crispasr` 0.4.3 (upstream CrispASR `main` @ `28e4f16`) — no pub.dev coordination, just push upstream first, then build downstream. The release-notes commit documents the exact upstream SHA so bisecting any issue can pin to a known-good pair.

### Watch for ancient tags that don't contain new work

Twice during this cycle we had tag divergence: `v0.4.3` was tagged on an older upstream commit that predated our VAD work. `git pull` silently put us at the old tag's HEAD, and the dylib we rebuilt was missing our changes. Fix: when switching CrispASR checkouts, always `git log --oneline main | head -5` and check the expected feature commit is there. `git tag --contains <commit>` is the right query for "which releases include my work".

---

## Upstream CrispASR v0.4.4–v0.4.8: what's now possible in-app

Every large piece of functionality the CrispASR CLI previously owned is reachable from Dart via `package:crispasr` 0.4.8:

| Capability | Dart surface | CrisperWeaver status |
|---|---|---|
| VAD + stitching | `CrispasrSession.transcribeVad()` | ✅ shipped v0.1.7 |
| Speaker diarization | `diarizeSegments(...)` | ⚠️ not yet — MFCC/k-means stopgap still in `diarization_service.dart` |
| Language ID | `detectLanguagePcm(...)` | ⚠️ not yet — UI currently assumes user sets language |
| CTC / forced alignment | `alignWords(...)` | ⚠️ not yet — word timestamps missing for qwen3/voxtral/granite/cohere |
| HF download | `cacheEnsureFile(...)` | ⚠️ not used — CrisperWeaver has its own Dio-based downloader |
| Model registry lookup | `registryLookup(...)` | ⚠️ not used — CrisperWeaver has its own model catalog |

The pattern is the same every time: the library call takes a PCM buffer + a model path, writes its answer into caller-allocated structs, and returns in one FFI hop. Wiring these is not engine work — it's service-layer plumbing matching the VAD wire-up from v0.1.7.

### App-sandbox cache vs `~/.cache/crispasr`

`cacheEnsureFile` / `cacheDir` from the lib write under `$HOME/.cache/crispasr` on POSIX. Works for desktop CrisperWeaver users who also use the CLI. Broken on iOS/Android where apps are sandboxed and `$HOME` points at the app container. For mobile, keep using the app's documents/caches dir (we already do via `path_provider`) and pass that as `cacheDirOverride` when we do start calling the lib's cache helper. Desktop users get the CLI-shared cache by default, mobile users get the sandboxed path — same symbol, different ambient configuration.

## Test-suite speed

### `tags:` on `group()` is not a flutter_test parameter

The dart test runner accepts `tags: [...]` on individual `test()` calls but not on `group()`. The naive group-level annotation:

```dart
group("slow stuff", () { ... }, tags: ["slow"]);  // analyzer error
```

fails with `The named parameter 'tags' isn't defined`. Apply tags per-test instead:

```dart
test("kokoro synth", tags: ["slow"], () { ... });
```

### `dart_test.yaml` `exclude_tags: slow` collides with CLI `--tags slow`

`flutter test --tags slow` after setting `exclude_tags: slow` in `dart_test.yaml` produces:

```
No tests match the requested tag selectors:
  include: "slow"
  exclude: "slow"
```

The intersection is empty. The CLI flag adds to include, doesn't clear the YAML exclude. Workaround: skip the YAML `exclude_tags` and rely on per-test `skip:` clauses (env-var-gated) to keep the default pass fast. Cost: tests with the slow tag still register and report as `Skip:` lines in default output, but they don't actually run.

### ggml-metal pipeline cache is per-process, not per-machine

ggml-metal compiles MSL pipelines lazily — every fresh process pays a 30-60 s "kernel JIT" cost per backend before the first decode step. The `pipelines` cache in `ggml_metal_device_t` is in-memory only; there's no env var to persist it, no `MTLBinaryArchive` integration in upstream. Two consequences:

1. **Running each test in its own `flutter test` invocation is the worst case.** Six backends × ~30 s JIT = ~3 min of pure overhead before any model decode happens. Bundling all opt-in roundtrips into a single `flutter test` invocation cut a 50 min serial sweep to ~25 min — even though each `CrispasrSession.open()` creates its own ggml_metal_device, Apple's system-level Metal driver caches compiled MSL within a process, so the second backend onward reuses pipelines for shared op shapes.
2. **CI runs are uncacheable today.** A persistent `MTLBinaryArchive` patch in `ggml/src/ggml-metal/ggml-metal-device.m` would write/read pipeline state objects to a per-device disk cache (`~/Library/Caches/ggml-metal/<device>.archive`), letting CI restore the cache between runs. ~half-day source patch; would cut sweep cost from ~25 min to ~5 min.

### `Hello world.` is too long for "is this dispatch arm wired" tests

A TTS model generates roughly one second of audio per 2-3 input words. "Hello world." → ~1.5 s of decode loop. "Hi." → ~0.5 s. For a "did the dispatch arm route correctly" test, neither produces interesting audio — but the shorter input saves 1 s × per-token-decode-cost across every TTS test in the suite. We use "Hi." across all four TTS roundtrips.

### 2 s ASR clip vs full sentence

`test/jfk-2s.wav` is the first 2 s of `test/jfk.wav` (`ffmpeg -t 2`). The full clip is 11 s of "And so my fellow americans, ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country." The 2 s trim only covers "And so my fellow americans" — `expect(transcript, contains("ask"))` fails because "ask" is in the back half. We assert `contains("americans")` instead, which is in both. ~5× faster ASR decode for the same dispatch verification.

## Flutter Web / PWA

### `dart:io` Platform causes white screen on web

`dart:io` compiles for web (dart2js stubs it) but `Platform.isWindows`, `Platform.operatingSystem`, etc. throw `UnsupportedError` at **runtime**. If any `Platform.*` call executes before `runApp()`, the app dies silently — white screen with no visible error (only in DevTools console). We had 47 files importing `dart:io` for Platform checks.

Fix: created `lib/utils/platform_utils.dart` with web-safe wrappers (`isWeb`, `isAndroid`, `isMacOS`, etc.) that return `false` on web instead of throwing. Replaced all 50+ `Platform.*` call sites across 23 files. Top-level initializers like `final bool _stderrUsable = stdioType(stderr)` are especially dangerous — they run at import time, not at call time.

### `file_picker` returns bytes on web, not paths

On native platforms, `FilePicker.pickFiles()` returns `PlatformFile.path` (a filesystem string). On web, `path` is always `null` — only `PlatformFile.bytes` (`Uint8List`) is available. The entire transcription pipeline (`transcribeFile(File(...))`) assumed filesystem paths.

Fix: added `fileBytes` / `fileNames` fields to `RobustFilePick`, a `transcribeBytes()` method on `TranscriptionService`, and a web-specific branch in the transcription screen that sends raw bytes to `HfSpaceEngine.transcribeBytes()` which POSTs them directly to the HF Space API.

### Vercel token types: `vca_*` vs `vcp_*`

`npx vercel login` stores an OAuth session token (`vca_*`) in `~/.local/share/com.vercel.cli/auth.json`. This works for local CLI commands but **fails** in CI with "The token provided via --token argument is not valid." CI needs a proper API token (`vcp_*`) created at vercel.com/account/tokens. The `~/.env` file has the correct `vcp_*` token.

### CrispEmbed WASM: Emscripten `-pthread` must be in compile flags, not just link flags

When compiling CrispEmbed to WASM, passing `-pthread` only in `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` is insufficient. Object files compiled without `-pthread` lack atomics/bulk-memory features, causing `wasm-ld: error: --shared-memory is disallowed by X.o because it was not compiled with 'atomics' or 'bulk-memory' features`. Fix: add `-pthread` to both `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`.

### COOP/COEP headers required for SharedArrayBuffer

WASM pthreads require `SharedArrayBuffer`, which browsers only enable under cross-origin isolation. The `vercel.json` must set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` headers. Without these, the WASM module falls back to single-threaded mode. HuggingFace model file downloads work under COEP because HF sets `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` on file responses.

### HF Space free-tier Docker build timeout is ~5 minutes

The HF free-tier Docker build has a hard timeout around 5–6 minutes. Compiling CrispASR from source (60+ C++ backends) takes 15+ minutes even with `-j1`. Solution: upload pre-built binaries to GitHub Releases and `curl` them in the Dockerfile instead of compiling. Changed from multi-stage build to single-stage with pre-built tarball.

### Ubuntu 24.04 in Docker: UID 1000 conflict and pip

Ubuntu 24.04 base images have a pre-existing `ubuntu` user with UID 1000. `useradd -u 1000 app` fails silently. Use `USER 1000` (numeric) instead of `USER app`. Also, pip requires `--break-system-packages` on 24.04 (PEP 668).

### HF Space free-tier: 3 cpu-basic slots max

The free tier allows 3 concurrent `cpu-basic` Spaces. Starting a 4th gives "Quota exceeded for flavor cpu-basic". Pause unused Spaces via `HfApi().pause_space('cstr/name')` to free slots.

### Kokoro g2p dict auto-download needs writable HOME

The `phonemizer.cpp` g2p dict auto-download writes to `$HOME/.cache/crispasr/`. In Docker containers running as non-root, `HOME` may point to a non-writable directory. Set `ENV HOME=/cache` (or another writable path) in the Dockerfile. Pre-downloading dicts at build time is more reliable than runtime auto-download.

### Shared library SOVERSION symlinks in tarballs

When packaging shared libraries (e.g. `libcrispasr.so.0.7.1`), the tarball must include SOVERSION symlinks (`libcrispasr.so.1 → libcrispasr.so.0.7.1`) because the binary links against the SOVERSION name, not the full version. Missing symlinks cause silent `dlopen` failures — the binary starts but can't find its libraries.

## Codebase optimization (June 2026)

### File size thresholds for splitting

**Symptom:** `model_service.dart` at 5696 lines mixed static catalog data (~4300 lines of `const` model definitions + language lists) with operational logic (download, verify, probe). Navigation was painful, IDE indexing slow, and review diffs enormous even for small logic changes.

**Fix:** Extract all static data + data classes into `model_catalog.dart` via an `abstract final class ModelCatalog` (non-instantiable container). The service re-exports it (`export 'model_catalog.dart'`) so all existing `import 'model_service.dart'` sites continue to work without changes.

**Rule of thumb:** when a file exceeds ~2000 lines, check whether it mixes data definitions with behavior. Data (enums, const maps, value classes) extracts cleanly; behavior (methods with side effects, I/O, state) usually can't be split without changing the API.

### HTTP client consolidation isn't always worth it

**Symptom:** the app depends on both `dio` (downloads with progress/resume) and `http` (simple JSON POST for LLM cleanup/summarize).

**Decision:** deferred. The 3 `http` call sites have 20+ `MockClient`-based tests that would all need rewriting for `dio`'s `HttpClientAdapter` mock pattern. The dependency overlap is small (both are transitive deps of other packages anyway), and the test churn risk outweighs the binary-size savings.

### optipng -o2 is the sweet spot for CI-friendly PNG compression

`-o7` on a 1 MB PNG takes 5+ minutes; `-o2` takes seconds and captures ~90% of the savings (37% reduction on 1024×1024 RGBA). Uncompressed PNGs from design tools often have inefficient IDAT encoding that lossless recompression fixes trivially.
