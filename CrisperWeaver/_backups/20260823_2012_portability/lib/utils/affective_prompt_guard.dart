// EU AI Act — the audio-Q&A prompts this app refuses to run.
//
// `CrispasrEngine.transcribe(askPrompt: …)` hands a free-text question to
// an instruct-tuned audio LLM (voxtral, qwen3-asr), which answers it from
// the audio instead of transcribing. That is a general capability and a
// legitimate one — "summarise this", "what was decided" — but it is also a
// route to emotion recognition that no output filter can close.
//
// `EmotionInference` works because SenseVoice emits a closed set of
// `<|HAPPY|>` literals at a single parse boundary. An LLM answering "the
// speaker sounds frustrated" is free prose: there is no tag to discard, no
// vocabulary to enumerate, and no boundary at which the inference is
// distinguishable from any other sentence. Output-side control is not
// available here, so the control moves to the input.
//
// **Why refuse rather than warn or disclose.** Art. 50(3) transparency is
// the wrong instrument: it binds deployers and presumes the system may
// lawfully run. Inferring emotions is *prohibited outright* in workplaces
// and educational institutions (Art. 5(1)(f)), the app cannot detect its
// deployment context, and a prohibition is not something a user can consent
// their way past. Outside those contexts, an emotion recognition system is
// Annex III 1(c) high-risk from 2 Dec 2027 — the obligation the badge in
// `AI_ACT_RISK.md` §2.8 was deleted to avoid. Running the prompt and
// labelling the answer would re-acquire exactly that obligation.
//
// **What this does not claim.** The list below is a keyword filter over a
// free-text field, and a determined user can defeat it by rephrasing
// ("describe the prosody", "is the speaker being sincere"). It is a control
// against the app *affording* emotion inference — which is what supplies the
// "intended purpose" in Art. 3(39) — not a guarantee that no model ever
// emits an affective sentence. That limit is stated here rather than
// discovered later, and it is the same honest posture as the discard list in
// `EmotionInference`: the control only works for the terms it names.
//
// Kept pure-Dart and dependency-free so the engine, the HTTP server, the CLI
// and the compliance suite all enforce one list.
